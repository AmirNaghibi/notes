\subsection{Root Cause Analysis}
	\label{subsec:root-cause-analysis}
\begin{easylist}

& Steps:
	&& Identify the problem and key indicator/symptom
	&& Iteratively identify any linked causes
	&& Identify the furthest root causes

& When creating an RCA:
	&& Don't leap to conclusions
	&& Focus on direct causations
	&& Consider context of each causation
	&& Create many branches

& \emph{Insight:} Understanding the underlying nature of a concept
	&& User insight:
		&&& Revelation about an aspect of users
		&&& Realization of new opportunities
	&& Methods of gaining insight:
		&&& \emph{Observation:} Perception of behaviour without interfering interaction
			&&&& Should be objective about behaviour and not include emotions or make inferrances
			&&&& Using observations, find insights
			&&&& \emph{POEMS framework:} When observing, pay attention to People, Objects, Environments, Messages, and Services
				&&&&& People: Who is present/involved?
				&&&&& Objects: What is involved? (e.g. equipment, materials, product, infrastructure)
				&&&&& Environments: Uniqueness in and characteristics of the environment (e.g. noise, temperature, crowdedness, privacy, security, atmosphere)
				&&&&& Messages: Information conveyed by/from people (e.g. other people in the vicinity, environment, advertising, promotions)
				&&&&& Services: Services offered and results
			&&&& Pay attention to:
				&&&&& Disjunctures and inconsistencies with previous understandings/observations
				&&&&& Revelatory incident which requires explanation and contextualization
				&&&&& Personal interpretations and differences between what is said and what is done
				&&&&& Cultural contextual issues
				&&&&& Metaphorical and symbolical experiences relating to a larger concept
