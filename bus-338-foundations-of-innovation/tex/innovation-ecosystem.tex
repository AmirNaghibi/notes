\section{Innovation Ecosystem}
	\label{sec:innovation-ecosystem}
\begin{easylist}

& \textbf{Innovation ecosystem:}

& Consists of:
	&& The end customers
	&& Intermediaries
	&& Complementors
	&& Influencers
	&& Upstream suppliers of each component
	&& Competitors

& In addition, identify:
	&& The value provided by the product
	&& Risks at each step
	&& Ways around road blocks
	&& Standards and regulations (e.g. legalities, taxes, workplace, trading, marketing, environment, manufacturing)

& Every downstream group between you and the customer must receive value from you

& \textbf{Execution risk:} Challenges in developing an innovation to specification within time and resource limitations
& \textbf{Co-innovation risk:} How a commercialization depends on the success of another commercialization
	&& E.g. Smartphones require the successful development of many components
& \textbf{Adoption risk:} How partners need to adopt an innovation before end consumers can access your product
	&& E.g. Michelin Run Flat tires were adopted by every partner except for the repair shops which did not carry the component
