\section{Communications Management}
	\label{sec:communications-management}
\begin{easylist}

& \textbf{Project plan:} Living document which describes the execution, monitoring, and control methods of the project
	&& Directs and allows management of objectives
	&& Built in collaboration with the team

& \textbf{Project communication:} Strategic management process for which the project manager is responsible
	&& Can alter behaviour
	&& Source of the communication is encoded into a message, conveyed in a medium, and decoded by the receiver
		&&& Can be altered by competing messages, noise, confusion, or other factors in between
	&& Difficult to quantify in results

& \textbf{Communications plan:} Schedule of how and when to communicate with stakeholders
	&& Methods of organization:
		&&& Events and times (e.g. milestones)
		&&& Documentation (e.g. charter, reports, closing document)
		&&& Stakeholders (see subsection~\ref{subsec:stakeholders})
			&&&& Stakeholders section may include owner

& Defining the information exchange with a stakeholder:
	&& Audience/target: Who is the stakeholder?
	&& Document format/content: What information is needed?
	&& Frequency/timing: When/how often will they need the information?
	&& Channel: How will the information be conveyed?
	&& Owner/contact: Who conveys the information?

\end{easylist}
\subsection{Stakeholders}
	\label{subsec:stakeholders}
\begin{easylist}

& \textbf{Stakeholder creep:} Phenomenon of people/organizations adding themselves to the group of stakeholders in order to be relevant

& Include those who:
	&& Control the scope
	&& Provide permission
	&& Complete the work
	&& Provide resources (e.g. supplies, people, time)
	&& Benefit or detract from the results

& \textbf{RACI analysis:} Accountability plan which maps tasks to the roles of stakeholders
	&& Conveys roles and responsibilities across organizational boundaries
	&& \textbf{R - Responsible:} Person responsible for performing a task
		&&& Ideally one person
	&& \textbf{A - Accountable:} Person accountable for the results of a task
		&&& Ideally one person
		&&& Can be same person as R
	&& \textbf{C - Consulted:} Person who must know and/or provide information before the task begins
		&&& Minimize to limit dependencies and speed up processes
	&& \textbf{I - Informed:} Person who must be notified after the task ends
	&& Process:
		&&& Identify stakeholders
		&&& Define tasks
		&&& Create a matrix with stakeholders and tasks
		&&& Assign RACI roles
		&&& Analyze the matrix horizontally (through tasks) to ensure:
			&&&& At least one person is Responsible
			&&&& At least one person is Accountable
			&&&& There are not too many people who must be Consulted
			&&&& There are not too many people who must be Informed
		&&& Analyze the matrix vertically (through stakeholders) to ensure:
			&&&& No one person has too many tasks for which they are Responsible
			&&&& No one person has too many tasks for which they are Accountable
