\section{Controlling}
	\label{sec:controlling}
\begin{easylist}
	
& \textbf{Scope control:} Permitting only changes which are agreed upon
	&& \textbf{Scope creep:} Uncontrolled changes to project scope
	&& Change Control Process used to process requested scope changes and corrective actions
& \textbf{Schedule control:} Process of controlling project schedule changes
	&& Determine current status, determine influencing factors of schedule changes, identify schedule changes, and manage changes
	&& Tools: Progress reports, performance measurement, software
& \textbf{Cost control:} Process of controlling project cost changes

& Methods of project control:
	&& \textbf{Project/activity log:} Document recording occurrences throughout the project
	&& Progress/status report: Consistent recurring communication to stakeholders on project status
	&& Measurements
		&&& \textbf{Earned Value:} Technique to analyze variance of project performance (technical/scope, schedule/time, and cost)
			&&&& Budgeted Cost at Completion (BAC): Total budget for the project
			&&&& \textbf{Planned Value (PV):} Total budgeted cost for an activity
			&&&& \textbf{Actual Cost (AC):} Cost spent so far for an activity
			&&&& \textbf{Earned Value (EV):} Value of the work performed so far for an activity, based on the total project budgeted cost
				&&&&& Equation: $EV = BAC \times \textrm{Percentage completed}$
			&&&& \textbf{Cost Variance (CV):} Difference between Earned Value and Actual Cost
				&&&&& Equation: $CV = EV - AC$
			&&&& \textbf{Schedule Variance (SV):} Difference between Earned Value and Planned Value
				&&&&& Equation: $SV = EV - PV$
			&&&& \textbf{Cost Performance Index (CPI):} Ratio of Earned Value to Actual Cost
				&&&&& Equation: $CPI = \frac{EV}{AC}$
			&&&& \textbf{Schedule Performance Index (SPI):} Ratio of Earned Value to Planned Value
				&&&&& Equation: $SPI = \frac{EV}{PV}$
