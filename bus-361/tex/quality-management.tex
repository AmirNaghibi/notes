& \textbf{Project quality:} Degree to which characteristics fulfill requirements
	&& \textbf{Grade:} Classification of a product based on its technical characteristics
	&& Low-grade may be acceptable; low-quality is unacceptable

		&&& Application and assurance of quality standards
		&&& Control and analyzing of quality using tools and techniques such as:
			&&&& Audits
			&&&& Adherence to guidelines
			&&&& Statistical sampling
			&&&& Inspection
			&&&& Graphs (e.g. flowcharts, histograms, scatterplots, pareto charts, fishbone diagrams)

& Trade-offs between scope, quality, cost, and schedule to avoid:
	&& Overwork resulting in mistakes and delays
	&& Rushing quality inspections resulting in undetected errors
	&& Exceeding quality objectives resulting in unbudgeted higher costs
	
& ISO Quality Management Framework:
	&& Customer satisfaction: Extent to which customers' needs and expectations are fulfilled
		&&& Involves requirement fulfillment and functional/emotional benefits of use
	&& Prevention over inspection: Concept of increasing cost over time to fix a lack of quality
	&& Responsibility of management to support
	&& Continuous improvement (Plan-Do-Check-Act cycle)
