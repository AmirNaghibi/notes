\begin{easylist}

& \textbf{Precondition:} Guarantee before a method is called
	&& Enforced by client, or else the class may have unintended behaviour
& \textbf{Postcondition:} Guarantee after a method is called
	&& Enforced by caller

& Implementation has a contract for the client to fulfill
	&& \textbf{Design by Contract:} Client is expected to enforce contract
		&&& Less error checking
	&& \textbf{Defensive Programming:} Paradigm where implementation checks for contractual violations and is responsible for maintaining correct state
		&&& Quicker error catching

& Use assert to maintain consistent internal state

\end{easylist}
