\section{Design Patterns}
	\label{sec:design-patterns}
\begin{easylist}

& \textbf{Lambda expression:} Short function implementation for an interface with only one method

& \textbf{Software design pattern:} Description of a common software design problem and a solution

& \textbf{Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY):}
	&& \textbf{Pulling-up:} Elimination of duplicate code by placing the code in a called function

& \textbf{Strategy pattern:} Design method which modularizes an algorithm by encapsulating it into a class
	&& E.g. FileFilter, Comparator
	&& Uses composition and can be swapped during runtime
		&&& Compatible with lambda functions
	&& Function accepts an interface as a parameter; the subclass passed into the function implements the algorithm

& \textbf{Template method:} Design pattern where a base class delegates primitive operations to derived classes inside a template method
	&& Requires inheritance and cannot be modified after compilation
	&& \textbf{Primitive operation:} Modular procedure overridden create different implementations of similar methods
	&& Algorithm is in the abstract base class which calls abstract primitive operations, which are overridden by subclasses

& \textbf{Static factory method:} Static method which creates an instance of its object, configured as per the method name

& \textbf{Dependency injection (DI):} Architectural design pattern where classes are passed references to dependencies
	&& Allows loose coupling by separating object instantiation/ownership from use
	&& \textbf{Constructor injection:} Dependency injection through a class constructor

& \textbf{Iterator:} Interface which allows abstraction of iteration over a set of objects
	&& Encapsulates implementation details

& \textbf{Observer pattern:} Design method where observer objects register for updates with a certain class
	&& Upon update, the class notifies all observer objects which retrieve the updates

& \textbf{Model View Controller pattern (MVC):}
	&& \textbf{Model:} Component(s) which handle data and application logic
	&& \textbf{View:} Component(s) which display information to users
	&& \textbf{Controller:} Component(s) which receive user interaction
	&& \textbf{Clean design:} Separating logic and display

& \textbf{Facade pattern:} Design pattern which encapsulates structure of the model code into a common interface
