\section{Interface Quality}
	\label{sec:interface-quality}
\begin{easylist}

& 4 characteristics of interface quality:
	&& \textbf{Cohesion:} Characteristic of an entity which has all its interfaces based on the same abstraction
		&&& \textbf{Single Responsibility Principle:} A class should only have one responsibility and reason to change
		&&& Break up classes if violated
	&& \textbf{Completion/convenience:} Characteristics of entity which has all relevant and necessary features
	&& \textbf{Clarity:} Characteristic of an entity which is easy to understand
		&&& Intention-revealing member names
		&&& Meaningful and relevant abstractions
	&& \textbf{Consistency:} Characteristic of an entity which is designed with consistent interactions

& Other evaluations of quality:
	&& Whether constructors create fully-formed objects
	&& Whether each idea has one name
	&& Whether command-query separation is followed
	&& Whether Iterable/Comparable are implemented when appropriate
	&& Whether encapsulation is respected
