\begin{easylist}

& Standards:
	&& Make fields private when possible

& Commenting:
	&& Comment purpose of a class
	&& Name fields/methods/parameters so comments are unnecessary

& When possible, convert strings to non-string types internally for consistency

& \textbf{Clean code:} Code which is correct, easy to read/maintain, and conforms to a standard

& Software design:
	&& 4 steps:
		&&& Requirements
		&&& Design and implementation
		&&& Verification
		&&& Evolution
	&& Designing involves identifying classes, responsibilities, and relationships to create a diagram
	&& Implementation process options:
		&&& \textbf{Skeleton code:} Beginning minimal parts/features of a system
		&&& \textbf{Component-wise:} Creating components one at a time
	&& Methods of integrating code from multiple people:
		&&& \textbf{Continual integration:} Gradual system growth by constantly integrating changes
		&&& \textbf{Big Bang integration:} Building all parts separately without integrating until the end

& \textbf{Feature envy:} Characteristic of a class which relies heavily on another class
& Warning sign: Characteristic of a method which operates more strongly on another object than its own
& \textbf{Deprecation:} State where a public interface is no longer supported or recommended, and is slated to be removed in the future


& \textbf{try-catch:} Structure which watches for an exception and handles it
	&& Only one exception can be live at a given time
	&& \textbf{finally clause:} Optional clause after catch clauses which is executed regardless of the result
		&&& If exception is thrown, the finally clause is executed immediately afterwards
	&& \textbf{try-with-resources:} Block which cleans up a resource when a try block exits

& Exception: Issue which may be fixable and is not out of the software's control
	&& \textbf{Checked exception:} Exception which must be caught or listed in a throws clause
	&& \textbf{Unchecked exception:} Exception which will automatically propagate and does not require catching
		&&& E.g. RuntimeException
		&&& Preferred as it does not require modification of methods between try/catch, which decouples code
