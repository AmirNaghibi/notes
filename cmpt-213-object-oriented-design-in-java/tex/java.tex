\begin{easylist}

& \textbf{this:} Keyword which refers to the current surrounding object
& Almost everything is an object except for primitive types (e.g. int, float, double, boolean)

& Assignment and parameterization passes by:
	&& Value for primitive types
	&& Reference for objects

& Type conversion:
	&& \textbf{Type promotion:} Implicit conversion from a smaller to larger type (e.g. int to double)
	&& \textbf{Type demotion:} Explicit conversion from a larger to smaller type (e.g. double to int)

& String literals are:
	&& Immutable
	&& Of the String class
	&& Compared with the equality operator using a reference

& Equality comparison compares by reference; \lstinline!.equals()! compares by value
	&& \lstinline!.equals()! must be overridden
	&& Using \lstinline!instanceof! violates symmetry for derived classes
	&& Using \lstinline!getClass()! violates Liskov Substitution Principle (ability of derived classes to share the same behaviour)

& \lstinline!hashCode()!:
	&& Used to sort objects into easily-searchable accessible buckets in a hash table
	&& Must be overridden with \lstinline!getClass()!
	&& Multiples the result of each previous step's addition of fields by 31 as this value is prime, odd and optimized on some hardware
	&& Shortcut for checking equality: If two objects have inequal hash codes, then they must not be equal

& Automatic garbage collection once no references to an object exist

& Collections store objects (not primitives)

& \textbf{Inner class:} Class within a file-level class
	&& If static, can be accessed without referencing the outer class
	&& Can receive a reference to final variables and methods in the outer class
		&&& Variables must be final (or not modified) because the method will be executed later, and a definitive value must be captured

& \lstinline!for-each! loops can take unmodifiable collections to iterate through, preventing side effects

& Common interfaces:
	&& Classes which are Iterable must implement the \lstinline!Iterator iterator()! method
	&& Classes which are Comparable must implement the \lstinline!int compareTo(Object obj)! method

& \textbf{Plain Old Java Object (POJO):} Java class/object which is basic and only interacts with Java classes, without external component access

& \textbf{Spring (Boot):} Dependency injection framework for Java
