\section{REST APIs}
	\label{sec:rest-apis}
\begin{easylist}

& \textbf{Application Program Interface:} Protocol for communicating with a program component
	&& \textbf{Create-Read-Update-Delete (CRUD):} Set of general operations to manage an entity
	&& \textbf{Idempotent:} Operation which has the same response when executed multiple times

& \textbf{Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP):}
	&& Ports:
		&&& HTTP port: 80
		&&& HTTPS port: 443

& \textbf{Model View Controller API:} Web application architecture where server sends fully formed HTML pages

& \textbf{Representational State Transfer (REST):} Web application architecture standard where client and server send and receive chunks of data
	&& Client sends a request to the server's endpoint
	&& Improves performance by caching
	&& \textbf{Uniform interface:} Interface which returns self-descriptive resources
	&& \textbf{Stateless:} Interface where all information about each request is contained, and no connection state is maintained by the application
	&& \textbf{Cacheable:} Implementation detail where as much information as possible is cached to minimize server load

& Request components:
	&& \textbf{Method:} Action by an endpoint
		&&& POST, DELETE, GET, PUT
	&& \textbf{Uniform Resource Locator (URL):} Endpoint to send the request to
	&& \textbf{Path variable:} Data within a URL
	&& \textbf{Query string:} Data as a non-hierarchical key-value pairs exposed in the URL, after a question mark
		&& Only available for GET requests
	&& \textbf{Header:} Data as a key-pair value
	&& \textbf{Body:} Data as a block

& Response components:
	&& \textbf{Response status code:}
		&& E.g. 200, 201, 401, 403, 404, 500

\end{easylist}
\subsection{Servers}
	\label{subsec:rest-apis:servers}
\begin{easylist}

& \textbf{Server:} Program in web development which exposes an API to consume

& \textbf{Controller:} Component in a server which manages the endpoints and parameters

\end{easylist}
