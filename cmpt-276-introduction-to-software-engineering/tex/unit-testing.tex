\begin{easylist}

	& \emph{Unit test:} Method of software programming in which the smallest dividable groups of modules are tested
	
	& Structure:
		&& Suites are a collection of fixture(s) and test fixture(s)
		&& Fixture classes provide setup and cleanup for testing an operation
		&& Test fixtures are a collection of tests, before which a specified fixture is created and after which the fixture is deleted
		
		&& After each test case, the expected results are compared with the actual results
	
	& Types of tests:
		&& Correct usages
		&& Repeated usages
		&& Incorrect usages (e.g. too many/few parameters)
		&& Edge cases (e.g. out-of-bounds, 0, invalid characters)
		&& Exploits (e.g. database injections)

	& Characteristics to test:
		&& Input validation
		&& Input sanitation
		&& States after an operation
		&& Usability
		&& Performance
