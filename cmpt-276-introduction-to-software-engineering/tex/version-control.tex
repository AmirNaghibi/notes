\section{Version Control}
	\label{sec:version-control}
\subsection{Introduction}
	\label{subsec:version-control:introduction}
\begin{easylist}

	& \emph{Version control:} Flow of software development in which changes to the code are modular and documented, allowing for clear revision history and simple reversion of changes

	& Repositories are hosted on a central website
		&& Reasons:
			&&& Developers can access the code
			&&& The project can be documented (e.g. issuse, merge/pull requests, features, bugs, code review)
		&& E.g. GitHub, Bitbucket, GitLab

	& Allows specification of:
		&& Which changes constitute a unique version
		&& Who has authority to accept changes

	& \emph{Workflow:} Convention for how changes move from the developer's repository into the centralized system
	& \emph{Development process:} Convention for how software development is handled

\end{easylist}
\subsection{Types of Systems}
	\label{subsec:version-control:types-of-systems}
\begin{easylist}

	& \emph{Centralized:} Version control which uses a single central repository to which users can contribute
		&& E.g. SVN

	& \emph{Distributed:} Version control which allows for multiple repositories, both for the individual programmers and original developers
		&& E.g. Git, Mercurial, Bazaar

\end{easylist}
\subsection{Workflow}
	\label{subsec:version-control:workflow}
\begin{easylist}

	& Requires Git and a hosting service
	& \emph{Issue:} Possible change to a project
		&& E.g. New features, bugs, performance enhancements

	& Process:
		&& An issue is opened
		&& Contributors discuss the issue
		&& Issue may be:
			&&& Closed (if it is determined to be impossible, unfeasible, etc.)
			&&& Altered
			&&& Divided into multiple, smaller issues
			&&& Allowed to be implemented through consensus
		&& A contributor is assigned the issue
		&& The contributor implements the change on a new branch and sends a pull/merge request
		&& Issue may be:
			&&& Altered further and the change revised
			&&& Accepted and merged into the main branch

\end{easylist}
\subsection{Commits}
	\label{subsec:version-control:commits}
\subsubsection{Overview}
	\label{subsubsec:version-control:commits:overview}
\begin{easylist}

	& Keep a commit focused on one independent change

\end{easylist}
\subsubsection{Messages}
	\label{subsubsec:version-control:commits:commit-messages}
\begin{easylist}

	& First word:
		&& Capitalized
		&& Verb
		&& Present tense

	& Describes the problem/change/behaviour
	& Under 50 characters (commit messages longer than 50 characters are often cut off on the online version control system)
	& No end-of-sentence punctuation

	& Other sources:
		&& \href
