\section{Synchronization}
	\label{sec:synchronization}
\begin{easylist}

& \textbf{Race condition:} Data inconsistency when multiple processes manipulate shared data concurrently and the result varies depending on the order of execution
	&& To avoid, set code as the \textbf{critical section} so only one process can execute their CS at the same time

& \textbf{Producer-Consumer Problem:} Two processes (threads) share a buffer where the producer thread places items into the buffer (waiting if full) and the consumer thread removes items from the buffer (waiting if empty)
	&& Both threads should update a counter of the number of items in the buffer
		&&& \textit{Issue:} Race condition may occur when the counter is incremented or decremented, if the CPU scheduler switches between them at that instruction
	&& \textit{Issue:}







& \textbf{Semaphore:}
	&& Non-busy waiting semaphore: Integer value with queue
		&&& Can block to suspend the process or %TODO
	&& \textit{wait} and \textit{signal} are critical sections to avoid further race conditions
		&&& Busy waiting is shortened
	&& Value of 0 (false) means that a process is waiting; value of 1 (true) means that no process is waiting
	&& Issue: Process may release lock and then immediately relock, which creates a problem of prioritization
	&& If a part of a process P2 should be executed only after the execution of a part of another process P1, then there can be a \textit{signal} after the part in P1 and a \textit{wait} before the part in P2
	&& Issue: Deadlock can occur if multiple sempahores are accessed in the incorrect order, if processes block forever and do not release resources, % TODO
		&&& Example: When both process wait for signals from the other process, which occur after the waits
		&&& E.g. % TODO Code

& Classical synchronization problems: Abstractions which can... %TODO
	&& \textbf{Bounded-Buffer (Producer-Consumer) Problem:} See above
		&&& Issues are a violation of modification of the count, producing when full, and consuming when empty
			&&&& Solution: Use 3 semaphores - mutex initialized to 1, full initialized to 0, empty initialized to N
	&& \textbf{Readers-Writers Problem:}
	&& \textbf{Dining-Philosophers Problem:} 5 philosphers in a circle have one chopstick in between each of them
		&&& Solution: Use 5 semaphores (chopstick [0..5])
			&&&& Deadlock: If every thread picks up one chopstick, then no chopsticks are available to unblock
			&&&& Deadlock solution: Take both chopsticks only when available
			&&&& Deadlock solution: Odd threads will take only one side first and even threads will take only right side first

\end{easylist}
\subsection{Deadlocks}
	\label{subsec:synchronization:deadlocks}
\begin{easylist}

& \textbf{Deadlock prevention:}

& \textbf{Deadlock avoidance:}

& \textbf{Deadlock detection:}
	&& Wait-for graph % TODO
	&& Algorithm invoked when CPU utilization is less than 40\% (occurs occasionally)

& \textbf{Deadlock recovery:} Removal of a deadlock situation
	&& \textbf{Victim:} Process which is targeted in an attempt to remove a deadlock
		&&& Determined by priority, execution time, remaining execution time, resources used, resources needed, number of processes required to be terminated, interactive/batch execution
	&& \textit{Process termination:} A process is aborted continually until the deadlock cycle is eliminated
		&&& At least one process for each disjoint cycle must be aborted
	&& \textit{Resource pre-emption:} A resource is pre-empted from some processes
		&&& \textbf{Rollback:} Returning of a process and its resources to a safe state and restarting it
		&&& \textit{Starvation:} Same process may be continually re-chosen as victim




& \textbf{Memory Management Unit (MMU):} Hardware component which translates logical addresses to physical addresses
	&& Hardware, not software because of high usage (every CPU instruction requires the MMU)
	&& Memory protection:
		&&& If an address out of bounds is accessed, the MMU will raise a trap which is translated to a segmentation fault

% Secion: Allocation

& Memory has two partitions for resident OS and user processes
& \textbf{Contiguous allocation:}
	&& Requires management of information about allocated and free partitions
	&& \textbf{Memory fragmentation:} Dissociation of usable memory holes across a large space
		&&& \textbf{External fragmentation:} Situation where there exists enough memory to satisfy a request but the memory is fragmented across memory and not contiguous
		&&& \textbf{Memory compaction:} Moving contents of memory to combine free memory into a larger block
			&&&& Only possible if relocation is dynamic during execution time
	&& \textbf{Internal fragmentation:} Situation in paged memory where the allocated memory is larger than the requested amount, and cannot be utilized as it is internal to the allocated partition
& \textbf{Paging/Non-contiguous allocation:} Allocation of memory for a process wherever available
	&& \textbf{Frame:} Fixed-size block of physical memory containing part of the data of a process, with the same size as a page
		&&& Sized by power of 2
		&&& OS tracks free frames
	&& \textbf{Page:} Fixed-size block of logical memory containing part of the data of a process, with the same size as a frame
	&& \textbf{Page table:} Translation map which maps logical addresses to physical addresses
	&& Address transition:
	&& \textbf{Hierarchical page table:} Page table which provides address mapping to a set of page tables which maps to process data
		&&& Pros:
			&&&& Process data page tables do not need to be in contiguous memory
			&&&& Page tables can be created on-demand
		&&& Cons:
	&& \textbf{Hashed page table:} Page table which hashes a page number to a page table
		&&& Collisions create linked list chain of elements which are searched for the correct value
			&&&& Cost of searching is linear
		&&& Common for address spaces with less than 32 bits
	&& \textbf{Inverted page table:} Page table which contains an entry for each physical memory frame
		&&& Table is searched for the matching page number stored in an entry, and moves to the corresponding frame
		&&& Pros:
			&&&& Only requires one instance for all processes
			&&&& Less memory required to store page table
		&&& Cons:
			&&&& Increases search time
				&&&&& Can be alleviated with a hash table

\end{easylist}
\subsection{Segmentation}
	label{subsec:synchronization:segmentation}
\begin{easylist}

& \textbf{Segment:} Component of a program which is a logical unit
	&& Example: Main program, functions/procedures/methods, objects/variables, stack, arrays

& Logical address:
	&& Denoted by (\textit{segment number}, \textit{offset})
& \textbf{Segment table:} Table which maps a logical address to a physical address
	&& \textbf{Base:}
	&& \textbf{Limit:}
	&& Processing steps:
		&&& Add the segmentation value to the difference Value
		&&& Check whether the combined value is greater than the limit
		&&& If it is beyond the limit, a trap is raised
		&&& If it is valid, the data is retrieved from the segment
