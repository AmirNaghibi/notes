\section{Constraint Satisfaction Problems}
	\label{sec:constraint-satisfaction-problems}
\begin{easylist}

& \textbf{Constraint satisfaction problem (CSP):} Problem where a set of constraints acts on a set of variables, and the solution is a set of variable values which satisfies all constraints
	&& E.g. Sudoku, assiging resources to tasks, map colorings
	&& Formulation of a CSP:
		&&& Specify the variables
		&&& Specify the domain $D$ of possible values for the variables
		&&& Specify contraints

& \textbf{Backtracking search:} Depth-first search which assigns possible values to variables, and backtracks when a variable has no valid values
	&& Complete: Yes
	&& Runtime: $O(n! D^n)$ (actually $O(k^n)$ where $k$ = number of values, $n$ = number of variables)
		&&& For each of $n$ variables, there are $D$ options
		&&&& Unary constraint: Restriction which only applies to a single variable
	&& Space: $O(m)$ where $m$ is the maximum depth
	&& Improvements:
		&&& \textbf{Forward checking:} Assigning to each variable an early set of possibilities restricted by constraints, independent of other variables
		&&& \textbf{Arc consistency:} Whether for each value of a variable there is a valid value for all other variables sharing a binary constraint
			&&&& Runtime complexity of enforcing arc consistency first: $O(n^2 D^2)$
			&&&& $k$ consistency has runtime $O(n^k D^k)$
		&&& Heuristics:
			&&&& \textbf{Minimum-remaining-values heuristic:} Assigning variables starting from those with the least possible number of values, to maximize early failure in order to minimize the number of changed values
			&&&& \textbf{Maximum-degree heuristic:} Assigning variables starting from those which share the most constraints with other variables, to prune future options faster
				&&&&& Used for tiebreakers or starting
			&&&& \textbf{Least-constraining-value heuristic:} Assigning variable values starting from the values which constrain other variables least, to minimize value failure

& \textbf{Local search:} Heuristic which uses iterative improvement on an arbitrary sub-optimal solution
	&& Choose candidates by the variable(s) which violate constraints, using all domain values
	&& Complete: No
	&& Runtime: Unknown
	&& Space: $O(n)$
	&& Methods to choose the next solution:
		&&& \href{https://towardsdatascience.com/simulated-annealing-for-clustering-problems-part-1-3fa8994a3ebb}{\textbf{Hill-climbing search or gradient descent/ascent:}} Local search algorithm which chooses following candidate which violates the fewest constraints
			&&&& Terminates when it reaches a peak where no neighbor has a higher value
			&&&& \textbf{Simulated annealing:} Hill-climbing search algorithm which allows for moderate suboptimal moves (with decreased frequency over time) to escape local maxima and reach a global maximum
				&&&&& Complete: Yes

& \href{https://towardsdatascience.com/introduction-to-genetic-algorithms-including-example-code-e396e98d8bf3}{\textbf{Genetic algorithm:}} Search algorithm maintains a fixed-size set of solutions, from which the optimal individuals are selected to create the successive set of solutions, evolving to a global optimal state over time
