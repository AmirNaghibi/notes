\subsection{Uninformed Algorithms}
	\label{subsec:uninformed-algorithms}
\begin{easylist}

& \textbf{Breadth-first search:} Utilizes a queue
	&& Time and space complexity: Bounded by the number of nodes the same distance away from the root as the goal node
	&& Complete if branching factor is finite

& \textbf{Uniform-cost search:} Utilizes a priority queue to follow the path with least cost
	&& Time and space complexity: Bounded by the branching factor to the power of the average action cost
	&& Complete if branching factor is finite and step costs $\leq \epsilon$

& \textbf{Depth-first search:} Utilizes a stack
	&& Time complexity: Bounded by the maximum depth of the tree
	&& Space complexity: Bounded by the length of the maximum-length path, and its remaining unexpanded child nodes for each node on the path
	&& Not complete
	&& More space-efficient than breadth-first search

& \textbf{Iterative deepening (depth-first) search:} Depth-first search with maximum limited depth, which increases until the goal is found
	&& Complete if branching factor is finite
	&& Time complexity: Bounded by the number of nodes the same distance away from the root as the goal node
	&& Space complexity: Bounded by the length of the goal path, and its remaining unexpanded child nodes for each node on the path

\end{easylist}
\subsection{Informed Algorithms}
	\label{subsec:informed-algorithms}
\begin{easylist}

& \textbf{Admissible heuristic:} Underestimation of the true cost from a given node to the goal
	&& Notation for a function evaluating a heuristic: $h(n)$
	&& Will provide improved time and space complexity over the worst time
	&& To create an admissible heuristic, relax a rule/constraint and find the shortest solution given
	&& \textbf{Manhattan distance:} Number of unrestricted 4-directional moves from the goal state
	&& \textbf{Dominance:} Characteristic of an admissible heuristic which has a result greater than or equal to another admissible heuristic for all $n$
		&& Given admissible heuristics $h_a(n)$ and $h_b(n)$, $h(n) = \textrm{max}\left(h_a(n), h_b(n)\right)$ is also admissible and dominates $h_a(n)$ and $h_b(n)$

& \textbf{Greedy search:} Best-first search algorithm which chooses subsequent nodes by minimizing direct cost to the goal
	&& Complete: Only if state is checked for repeats
	&& Time and space complexity: At worst, bounded by all nodes

& \textbf{A* search:} Best-first search algorithm which expands only the paths with less cost than the optimal cost to the goal
	&& Evaluation function:

	\end{easylist}
	\begin{align*}
		f(n) & = g(n) + h(n) \\
		\textrm{where }
		& f(n) = \textrm{ estimated total cost of the path through } n \textrm{ to the goal} \\
		& g(n) = \textrm{ cost so far to reach } n \\
		& h(n) = \textrm{ heuristic-estimated cost from } n \textrm{ to the goal}
	\end{align*}
	\begin{easylist}

	&& Complete: Yes (unless there are infinitely many nodes with $f \leq f(G)$)

\end{easylist}
