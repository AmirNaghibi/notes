\begin{easylist}

& Environment: Observable, deterministic, discrete
& \textbf{State}: Possible arrangement of entities and agents in the environment
	&& Transition: Change from an initial state to another state
		&&& Successor function: Mapping from the current state and action to a new state
			&&&& Notation: $(\textrm{state}, \textrm{action}) \rightarrow \textrm{state}$
		&&& Goal state: Desired end state
		&&& Goal test: Condition which determines whether or not the current state is the goal state
			&&&& Notation: $(\textrm{state}) \rightarrow \textrm{true/false}$
		&&& Path cost: Numeric cost to take a path
	 	&&& Includes the possibility of no change
	&& E.g. For a two-square grid of a possibly dirty carpet with a vacuum cleaner, there are 4 possibilities for the dirty squares and 2 possibilities for the vacuum cleaner
