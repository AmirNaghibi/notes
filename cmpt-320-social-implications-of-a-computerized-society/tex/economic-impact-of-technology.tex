\section{Economic Impact of Technology}
	\label{sec:economic-impact-of-technology}
\subsection{Fundamentals of Economics}
	\label{subsec:economic-impact-of-technology:fundamentals-of-economics}
\begin{easylist}

& Model of profit:
	&& Market share $\times$ price = revenue
	&& Revenue $-$ production costs $-$ input costs (e.g. labour, materials, machines) $-$ processing costs = profit

& \textbf{Productivity:} Output per input hour of work

& \textbf{Collusion:} Illegal secret agreement between two entities to limit competition
	&& E.g. Silicon Valley's anti-poaching agreement
	&& Legal penalties exist (e.g. Canada's Competition Bureau)
	&& Legal alternative: Merging
		&&& Creates a monopoly
		&&& Decreases competition
		&&& Increases prices

& Median family income has increased by 10\% from 2005 to 2015

& Natural monopolies:
	&& Technology allows for greater networking abilities which may lead to first-mover advantages
	&& Companies grow to dominate a market (e.g. Google)

\end{easylist}
\subsection{Economic Models}
	\label{subsec:economic-impact-of-technology:economic-models}
\begin{easylist}

& \textbf{Smith's ideal competitive market/free market/classical model:} Economic model driven by rational self-interest where:
	&& All agents understand all possible products and prices,
	&& No barriers to market entry exist, and
	&& No transaction costs exist

& \textbf{Bertrand competition:} Economic model of competition where sellers setting prices and customer buying products creates an equilibrium of prices slightly above production costs
	&& Any seller which sells below cost will lose money
	&& Any seller which sells at cost will have no profits
	&& Any seller which is undercut by another seller will have no market share and must match the price
	&& Can be unbalanced by collusion

& \textbf{Marxist conflict due to the means of production:} Economic model in which those who contribute value to a product conflict on the share of profits
	&& Means/factors of production include land, capital (e.g. money to purchase and maintain equipment), labour
	&& Destructive class struggle between the advantageous owners of the capital and the workers who provide labour

& \textbf{Keynesian demand-side economics:} Economic model where increased spending creates increased income with which to spend more
	&& Contrary to Bertrand's model, demand occurs externally and is not fixed
	&& Feedback loop: Increased investment increases wages which increases demand which increases profit which increases investment
	&& \textbf{Demand weakness:} Net saving in the economy which creates increased unemployment and triggers a recession
		&&& Should be fixed by government spending more and going into debt to create demand
			&&&& E.g. Henry Ford raising wages
			&&&& E.g. Roosevelt's New Deal
	&& \textbf{Golden Rule:} Target of wages growing by productivity + inflation rate

& \textbf{Schumpeter's innovation and enterprise model:} Economic model where disruptive innovation against large entities is prioritized by economic policies to promote economic growth
	&& Strengthens the first-mover advantage to create temporary monopolies
	&& E.g. Apple's disruption of the cell phone market
	&& E.g. Uber's disruption of taxi services

\end{easylist}
\subsection{The Impact of Technology}
	\label{subsec:economic-impact-of-technology:the-impact-of-technology}
\begin{easylist}

& Less `friction' in the market due to:
	&& Lower transaction and processing costs
	&& Greater connections between customers/vendors

& Globalization of employment:
	&& \textbf{Outsourcing:} Contracting an external company to create components of a product or service
	&& \textbf{Offshoring:} Moving business processes to other countries to reduce costs
	&& \textbf{Inshoring:} Domestic workers being employed by a foreign company

& Production and employment changes:
	&& \textbf{Job churn:} Period between 1993 and 2002 in the US when 310 million jobs ended and 328 million jobs were created (resulting increase of 18 million jobs)
	&& Reduction of employment due to technology:
		&&& Agricultural workers
		&&& Telephone operators
		&&& Mid-level managers
		&&& Bank tellers
	&& Technology eliminates dirty, dangerous, and/or difficult jobs
	&& \textbf{Productivity paradox:} Increases in IT have not increased productivity or growth
		&&& \textbf{Parkinson's Law:} ``Work expands to fill the time available for its completion''
