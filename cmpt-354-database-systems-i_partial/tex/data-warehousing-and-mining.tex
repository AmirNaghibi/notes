	& Traditional DBMSes are used to main data to record day-to-day operations
		&& Online Transaction Processing (OLTP):
	& Content and historical data is analyzed to identify patterns
		&& Uses:
			&&& Market research to target products to a particular market segment
			&&& Decision support for high-level decision-making

\begin{easylist}
		
	& \emph{Data warehouse}: Consolidation of data from multiple databases in order for analysis of global patterns
		&& Allows high-level decision making covering many aspects of an organization
		&& Currency of data is not a priority
		
	& Data is:
		&& Extracted from databases and other sources (heterogeneous sources)
		&& Cleaned to minimize errors and missing information
		&& Transformed to match semantics (semantic integration)
		&& Loaded into the warehouse (metadata management - data such as load date, source, etc.)
		&& Indexed for efficiency
		&& Summarized
		
	& Issues:
		&& %TODO
		
	&  
	
	% NO data mining
