\section{NoSQL}
	\label{sec:nosql}
\subsection{Introduction}
	\label{subsec:nosql:introduction}
\begin{easylist}

	& For a comparison with SQL, see subsection~\ref{subsec:introduction:types-of-databases}

	& Possible definitions:
		&& No SQL
		&& Not only SQL
		
	& No schema
		&& Key-value store allows any data to be associated with the key
		&& No restrictions on what is contained
		&& Column family databases allow any type of data in any column
		
	& Common characteristics:
		&& Does not use relational model
		&& Runs well on clusters
		&& Built for modern web applications
		&& Lack a schema
		&& Open source
		
	& \emph{Aggregate:} Collection of related units which is used like a single unit
		&& Allows easier operation in clusters (see %TODO ref
		&& Used as a unit for replication and sharding
		&& Designed with respect to how the data is manipulated
		&& Data related to a single aggregate should be held at a single cluster
		&& Examples:
			&&& A bank Branch object containing a container of associated accounts
			&&& A bank Account object is independent of a Branch, and contains a reference to it
			
	& Possible properties:
		&& BASE:
			&&& Basically Available
			&&& Soft state
			&&& Eventually consistent
				&&&& Allow temporary inconsistency until all nodes sync information
		&& Do not follow the ACID properties
		&& See \hyperref[subsec:nosql:issues]{Issues}
			
\end{easylist}
\subsection{Distribution of Data}
	\label{subsec:nosql:distribution-of-data}
\begin{easylist}
			
	& Stored data must be distributed across the cluster
	
	& \emph{Sharding:} Distribution of data across several nodes
		&& Users should be able to retrieve most or all their relevant data from a single server
		&& Data can be sharded by:
			&&& Physical location (e.g. Vancouver servers)
			&&& Aggregates which are likely to be accessed together, or in sequence from the same location
		&& Often automatically done by the database
		&& Advantages:
			&&& Improved read/write performance
		&& Disadvantages:
			&&& Decreased resilience (higher chance of failure due to many machines)
	& \emph{Replication:} Maintenance of multiple copies of data
		&& Advantages:
			&&& Improved resilience and availability
		&& Disadvantages:
			&&& Replication schemas handle writes in different ways
			&&& May create inconsistency
		&& \emph{Master-slave replication:} Replication where a single copy is maintained as the `definitive' copy
			&&& Updates are performed on the master copy and sent to the slaves
			&&& Reads are performed on the slaves
			&&& If the master fails, one of the slaves becomes the new master
			&&& Advantages: %TODO
				&&&& G
				&&&& Master is a single point of failure
			&&& Disadvantages:
				&&&& Does not improve write readability
		&& \emph{Peer-to-peer replication:} 
			&&& %TODO
			
	& Combination of sharding and replication:
		&& Each shard is replicated
		&& Master-slave replication: One master for each shard
		&& Peer-to-peer replication:
			&&& Commonly used for column family databases
		%TODO
		
\end{easylist}
\subsection{Distributed Concurrency}
	\label{subsec:nosql:distributed-concurrency}
\begin{easylist}

	& %TODO
	& Concurrency is complex on a distributed system
	& When any node can process updates:
		&& Conflicts must be detected across notes
		&& Updates are processed in the same order
	& Aggregate-oriented databases support atomic transactions within aggregates, but not necessarily across aggregates
		&& \emph{Inconsistency window:} Period of time when reads may be inconsistent due to updates affecting multiple aggregates
	& %TODO
	& Distributed systems must have partition tolerance
	
\end{easylist}
\subsection{Issues}
	\label{subsec:nosql:issues}
\begin{easylist}

	& Consistency/availability/: %TODO
		&& Given a peer-to-peer system
		
\end{easylist}
\subsection{Categories}
	\label{subsec:nosql:categories}
\begin{easylist}

	& \emph{Key-value store:} Database which stores only one key and one value per row
		&& Value is not usable except for direct storage/extraction (stored as binary)
		&& Structurally simple
		&& Uses:
			&&& Session information
			&&& User profiles and preferences
			&&& Shopping carts
		&& Consistency is... %TODO
		&& Transactions vary between products/implementations
		&& Queries are done on the key only
		&& Scaling is done by sharding by the key's value
		
	& \emph{Document database:} Database which stores only documents
		&& \emph{Document:} Self-describing hierarchical tree structure
			&&& E.g. XML, JSON
		&& Differences compared to a key-value store:
			&&& Value can only be a document
			&&& Document can be compared/examined
		&& Uses master-slave replication
		&& Level of consistency can be specified (i.e. manual specification of the number of nodes to which an update must be propagated before it is considered successful)
		&& Availability is improved through duplicated data across nodes
			&&& Master-slave replication allows 
		&& Scaling:
			&&& For reads: Adding more slaves
			&&& For writes: Sharding
		&& Uses:
			&&& Event logging
			&&& Content management systems
			&&& Web analytics
		&& E.g. MongoDB, CouchDB
		
	& \emph{Column-family store:} Database which groups column families and is a refined columnar database
		&& \emph{Columnar database:} Database which stores each column separately
			&&& Increased speed of aggregate operations on column data (e.g.
			\begin{lstlisting}
COUNT()
			\end{lstlisting}
			)
			&&& Decreased speed of access on an entire row
			&&& Similar to \hyperref{sec:normalization}{Normalization} by how the table is reduced/broken up
		&& Multiple related columns: %TODO
		&& Uses peer-to-peer replication
		&& Level of consistency can be specified (i.e. manual specification of the number of nodes which must respond to an update before it is committed)
		&& %TODO More
		&& Queries are not as rich as SQL but are similar
		&& Uses:
			&&& Event logging
			&&& Content management systems
			&&& Blogging sites
			&&& Counters
		&& E.g. Cassandra, HBase, Amazon SimpleDB
	
	& \emph{Graph database:} Database which stores relationships between objects
		&& Nodes map to entities
		&& Edges:
			&&& Map to relationships
			&&& Can have types
			&&& Can be bidirectional
		&& Traversing relationships is efficient
		&& Uses:
			&&& Connected data such as social networks
			&&& Location-based services
			&&& Recommendation engines
		&& E.g. Neo4j, Titan, OrientDB
