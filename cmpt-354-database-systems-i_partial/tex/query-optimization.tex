	& \emph{Query optmization:} Process of finding an equivalent and more efficient query
		&& Process:
			&&& Convert the SQL query to relational algebra
			&&& Find equivalent queries and their estimated costs
			&&& Choose the most efficient query
		&& Modern DBMSes automatically optimize queries

	& Process of an unoptimized query:
		&& Read as much of the first table into main memory as possible
		&& Scan the second table in the Cartesian product for each block of records in main memory
		&& Output the resulting records
	& Process of an optimized query:
		&& Apply other operations when/before each Cartesian product/natural join is computed
			&&& Selection and projection do not require additional reads/writes

	& Example of a slow query:
	\begin{lstlisting}
SELECT C.customerID, C.lastName, A.balance
FROM Customer C, Owns O, Account A
WHERE A.accNumber = O.accNumber AND
	C.customerID = O.customerID AND
	A.branchName = `London' AND
	C.firstName = `Bob'
	\end{lstlisting}
	
		&& Process:
			&&& Computes the Cartesian product of the three tables
			&&& Selects any records which match the given conditions
			&&& Projects all columns in the SELECT list (in the final table)
	
	& Example of a faster query:
	\begin{lstlisting}
SELECT C.customerID, C.lastName, A.balance
FROM (SELECT accNumber, balance
	FROM Account
	WHERE branchName = `London' ) AS A
	NATURAL INNER JOIN Owns
	NATURAL INNER JOIN
	(SELECT customerID, lastname
	FROM Customer
	WHERE C.firstName = `Bob') AS C
	\end{lstlisting}
		
		&& Process:
			&& Selects all records which match the given conditions
			&& Projects all columns in the SELECT list (in each separate table)
			&& Computes the natural join of the three resulting tables
				
	& Indexing may reduce the cost of a selection (see %TODO indexing, subsection~\ref{})
