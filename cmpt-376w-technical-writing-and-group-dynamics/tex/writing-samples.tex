& ``Decisions in regard to administration of medication despite inability of an irrational patient appearing in a Trauma Center to provide legal consent rest with the attending physician.''
	&& `appearing' is redundant
	&& `in a Trauma Center' is a nominalization which should be changed to a noun/subject modifier
	&& Rewrites:
		&&& ``Despite the inability of an irrational Trauma Center patient to provide legal consent, decisions about the administration of medicine rest only with the attending physician.''
		&&& ``Only the attending physician may provide medication to a Trauma Center patient who is unable to provide legal consent.''
		&&& ``When a Trauma Center patient behaves so irrationally that they cannot legally consent to treatment, only the attending physician can decide to medicate them.''
& ``In the last several years, college costs have been rising so fast that they are now threatening the basis of our American democracy - equal opportunity for all. During that period, tuition has signicantly outpaced increases in family income. If this trend continues, a college education will soon be affordable only by the children of the wealthiest families in our society. When that happens, we will be divided as a people not only by wealth, but by knowledge and intellectual skills. Such a divide will erode equal opportunity and the egalitarian basis of our democratic society.''
	&& Rewrites:
		&&& ``Recent rising college costs undermine democracy by threatening equality of opportunity through tuition increasing faster than family income. If this continues, only the wealthiest will be able to afford a college education which will divide people by wealth, knowledge, and intellectual skill. This will erode equal opportunity.''
