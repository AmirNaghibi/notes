\section{Writing}
	\label{sec:writing}
\begin{easylist}

& Order clauses in sentence by descending salience/importance
	&& E.g. ``We compared the effects of the two hashing schemes on our algorithm's running time.'' to ``Two hashing schemes for the algorithm were evaluated for run time.''

& Structure of the proposal of a solution:
	&& Phrase the problem as a question
	&& Explain steps to solve the problem as exposition
	&& State the approach and solution

& \textbf{Hedging:} Avoidance of stating definitive conclusions
& \textbf{Rhetoric:} Use of language (spoken or written)
	&& E.g. ``I will build a great wall - and nobody builds walls better than me, believe me - and I'll build them very inexpensively, and I will make Mexico pay for that wall.''
	&& \textbf{Rhetorical situation:} Circumstances of conveying information through langauge

& \textbf{Shape:} Structure of the communication of ideas
	&& Reshaping a text involves reordering of ideas and changing of sentence length without addition or removal of ideas
	&& Keep the subject and verb close together to minimize confusion
	&& Begin the sentence with the key point (subject, verb, object) before delving into details
	&& Separate multiple subordinate clauses into new sentences
	&& E.g. ``Ph.D. students, who take a large share of their advisor's time by requiring detailed supervision constitute only a small fraction of the total student body.'' to ``Ph.D. students take a large share of their advisor's time by requiring detailed supervision. These students constitute only a small fraction of the total student body.''
	&& E.g. ``High-deductable health plans and Health Saving Accounts into which workers and their employees make tax-deductable deposits result in workers taking more responsibiltiy for their health care.'' to ``Workers take more responsibility for their health care when they adopt high-deductable insurance plans and Health Savings Accounts into which they and their employees deposit tax deductable contributions.''
	&& \textbf{Sprawl:} Overly long and complex sentence structure
		&&& Reading the sentence out loud will make you feel out of breath
		&&& Modifiers:
			&&&& \emph{Resumptive modifier:} Textual element continuing discussion on a concept dependent on a word or phrase repeated from a previous sentence
				&&&&& E.g. ``SFU is a good school. \textit{This school} has 25,000 undergraduate students.''
			&&&& \emph{Summative modifier:} Textual element continuing discussion on a concept dependent on summarizing the concept from a previous sentence
				&&&&& E.g. ``SFU is a good school for academia and co-op. \textit{This} makes it appealing to many students.''
			&&&& \emph{Free modifier:} Textual element continuing discussion on a concept dependent on the subject of the closest verb
				&&&&& E.g. ``SFU is a good school for academia and co-op, \emph{making} it appealing to many students.''
		&&& E.g. ``A musical group specializing in early music that insists on using either instruments that are actually old or instruments that have been created according to historical standards produces a sound markedly different from that of groups playing music on modern instruments.'' to ``Some musical groups specializing in early music insist on using either instruments that are actually old or instruments that have been created according to historical standards. The sound they produce is markedly different from that of groups playing early msuci on modern instruments.''
		&&& E.g. ``While grade inflation has been a subject of debate by teachers and administrators and even in newspapers, employers looking for people with high levels of technical and analytical skills have not had difficulty identifying desirable candidates.'' to ``Teachers, administrators, and media have debated grade inflation, but employers have found desirable college graduates with high levels of technical and analytical skills.''

& \emph{Stress:} Emphasis on clauses in a sentence
	&& First several words of a sentence state the topic
	&& Begin with peripheral, less important information
	&& Echo an earlier word or phrase
	&& Suspend the most important point for the end
	&& End with new information
	&& End with a clause containing `of'

& \emph{Elegance:} Use of appropriate and graceful words, phrases, sentences, and paragraphs to keep a reader's attention and interest
	&& Characteristics: Symmetry, balance, uniqueness, simplicity
	&& Avoid mannerisms, cliches, tricks
	&& Sound of the language is more important than the content
	&& Use metaphors/analogies
	&& Use coordination (e.g. and, but, for, how) for rhythm
	  &&& Use the shortest clause first and the longest clause last
		&&& Balance the lengths of clauses
		&&& \emph{Correlative conjunction:} Conjunctions that specify correlation or lack thereof of two nouns
			&&&& Provide balance and dramatic impact
			&&&& E.g. Both/and, neither/nor, either/or, not only/but also
	&& E.g. ``Thank you for the commitment, competence, thoughtfulness, and integrity you have demonstrated over the past 20 years.'' to ``Thank you for all you have given us over the past 20 years. Your commitment is matched only by your competence, your thoughtfulness only by your integrity.''

\end{easylist}
\subsection{Habits to Avoid}
\begin{easylist}

& Avoid using `firstly', `secondly', `finally'
	&& Be explicit with the enumerated item - e.g. `the first issue', `the final issue'
& Avoid starting sentences with `because'  because the clause at the beginning of the sentence will contain new information
	&& To prevent confusion, move the clause to the end of the sentence or use `since' (which reminds about old information)
& Avoid misleading pronouns such as ``this''

& \textbf{Monotony:} Lack of variation
	&& Rewriting examples:
		&&& ``Jeffrey would eat bananas, and he would throw them at his friends, and he would give them to his teachers, and he would sell them for a significant profit.'' to ``Jeffrey would eat bananas, throw them at his friends, give them to his teachers, and sell them for a significant profit.''

& \textbf{Metadiscourse:} Discussion of the text itself
	&& Should be avoided because it results in periphrastic  and redundant text
	&& Rewriting examples:
		&&& ``\textit{In this paper, we perform} an experiment that investigates whether GPU-optimized code performs better than code executing on both GPU and CPU.'' to "We study whether GPU-optimized code..."

\end{easylist}
\subsection{Concision}
\begin{easylist}

& \textbf{Concision:} Minimal usage of wording and complex clauses to convey information
	&& Avoidance of redundancy and repetition
	&& Ways to create concision:
		&&& Remove empty/filler words
		&&& Avoid redundant pronouns such as ``we''

& Rewriting examples:
	&& ``After that, Jeffrey went to the store again just like last time.''
		&&& ``Jeffrey went to the store again.''
	&& ``This interview with Steven Pinker discusses good and bad writing.''
		&&& ``Steven Pinker's interview discusses the quality of writing.''
		&&& ``Steven Pinker is interviewed about good and bad writing.''
	&& ``What beliefs do you believe in?''
		&&& ``What are your beliefs?''
		&&& ``What do you believe in?''
		&&& ``What do you believe?''
	&& ``The difficult experiment was completed with great difficulty.''
		&&& ``The experiment was completed with great difficulty.''
		&&& ``The incredibly difficult experiment was completed.''
		&&& Replace ``great difficulty'' with the reasons for difficulty
	&& ``The analysis was analyzed.''
		&&& ``It was analyzed.''
		&&& ``The analysis was completed.''
		&&& ``The analysis was examined/reviewed.''

\end{easylist}
\subsection{Cohesion and Coherence}
\begin{easylist}

& \textbf{Coherence:} Connection of ideas at the idea level
	&& Avoid:
		&&& Choppiness
		&&& Disorganization
	&& Should occur within and between sentences, paragraphs, chapters, sections, and the entire document
	&& Can be broken by unclear implication
	&& Depends on the background knowledge of the reader

& \textbf{Cohesion:} Connection of ideas at the sentence level
	&& \textbf{Faked/forced cohesion:} Using a conjunction when there is no logical connection between two clauses
		&&& Example: ``Jeffrey liked eating bananas; \textit{therefore} he received high marks on his homework.''
		&&& To avoid, remove all conjunctions as the text should still be clear without them

\end{easylist}
\subsection{Introduction}
\begin{easylist}

& Contents:
	&& High-level overview
	&& Define the problem
	&& Motivate the audience/reader that there is a conflict to be resolved
	&& Introduce basic terminology
	&& Summarize your contributions and results

\end{easylist}
\subsection{Body}
\begin{easylist}

& Contents:
	&& First paragraph should be a rough outline of the background information and the points to discuss
	&& Discuss related work
	&& Discuss and emphasize your contributions
	&& Explain significance of results

\end{easylist}
\subsection{Conclusion}
\begin{easylist}

& Contents:
	&& State the most important outcome
	&& Avoid simply summarizing the points from the body
	&& Interpret core points at a higher level of abstraction
	&& Demonstrate how you have addressed the need stated in the introduction
	&& Include perspectives about what could still be done about the issue
	&& Provide hindsight
	&& List open unanswered problems

\end{easylist}
