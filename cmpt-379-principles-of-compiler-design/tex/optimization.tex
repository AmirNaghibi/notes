\begin{easylist}

& \textbf{Constant folding:} Compile-time preprocessing of constant values to avoid predictable runtime computation
& \textbf{Constant propagation:} If a variable is set to a constant, then replace all future variable uses with the constant (until the variable is reassigned)
& \textbf{Copy propagation:} Simplification of multiple computations of the same values
& \textbf{Dead code elimination:} Removal of code which will never be executed, used, or have any side effects

& \textbf{Algebraic simplification:} Basic arithmetic and algebraic simplifications which are computed during compile-time such as addition by 0 or multiplication by 0 or 1
& \textbf{Reduction of strength:} Replacement of exponentiation with multiplication

& Correctness: Optimizations must not change the meaning of a performance
