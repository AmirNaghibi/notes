\begin{easylist}

& \textbf{Procedure:} Series of computational steps to be executed
	&& Assumption that execution is sequential (which can be violated by concurrency)
	&& Assumption that control is returned to the caller after execution (which can be violated by exceptions)
	&& \textbf{Activation:} Invocation of a given procedure
		&&& \textbf{Activation tree:} Tree of invoked procedures where each child node was invoked by its parent node
	&& \textbf{Lifetime (procedure):} Set of all the steps required to execute the associated procedure and its subprocedures
	&& Stack is used to keep track of all procedures which are currently active

& \textbf{Control Flow Graph (CFG):} Diagram showing logic flow of code, with branching on conditional commands such as if/for/while loops
