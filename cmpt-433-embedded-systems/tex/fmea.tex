\section{FMEA}
	\label{sec:fmea}
\begin{easylist}

& \textbf{Failure Mode and Effect Analysis (FMEA):} Overview of how system components could fail and details about the failure detection/likelihood/effects/risk

& For each failure possibility:
	&& Rate the severity (1-10)
	&& Rate the likelihood (1-10) based on causes
	&& Rate the effectiveness of detection (1-10)

& List possible actions to reduce risk

& \textbf{Risk Priority Number (RPN):} Failure rating which is represents the product of the severity, likelihood, and detection effectiveness (1-1000)

& \textbf{Danger zone:} A complex system which is tightly coupled and, therefore, difficult to test
