\section{Signals and Noise}
	\label{sec:signals-and-noise}
\begin{easylist}

& \textbf{Signal:} Value to be recorded
& \textbf{Ground:} 0V

& \textbf{Voltage regulator:} Component which converts unstable input voltage to a stable output voltage
& \textbf{Quantization:} Resolution of a single bit which involves a detectable change
& \textbf{Sample rate:} How quickly an A2D samples the input
	&& Audio requires high sample rates
	&& Potentiometers require low sample rates

& \textbf{Piecewise Linear (PWL):} Approximation of a function with a series of lines

& Strategies to tolerate noise:
	&& Change state only when a number of samples exceed the threshold
	&& Require additional value beyond the threshold in each direction to change the value
	&& Use a simple moving average of a past set of samples
	&& \textbf{Simple Moving Average:} Method of smoothing equally weights all values
	&& \textbf{Exponential Smoothing:} Method of smoothing which provides greater weights to recent values

& \textbf{Hysteresis:} Property of a state machine where the changes lag behind the actual values

& \textbf{Clamping:} Capping a signal at its maximum or minimum possible value to prevent overflow
