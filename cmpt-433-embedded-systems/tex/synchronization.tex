\begin{easylist}

& \textbf{Process:} Program which has a dedicated address space
	&& \textbf{Virtual access space:} Component of a process which is an abstracted memory location
	&& \textbf{fork():} Command which duplicates the address space of the current process
	&& \textbf{exec():} Set of commands which replaces the current process with an executable file

& \textbf{Thread:} Program which shares an address space with other instances of the same program
	&& Threads of the same process share a virtual access space, including global variables
& \textbf{Mutex:} Data structure which prevents simultaneous access to volatile data which may be changed
	&& \textbf{Critical section:} Section of code which can only be running once at a time
		&&& Keep critical sections as minimal as possible
& \textbf{Pipe:} Unidirectional data stream for inter-thread/process communication
