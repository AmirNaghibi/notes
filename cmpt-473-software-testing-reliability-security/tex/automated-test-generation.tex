\begin{easylist}

& \textbf{Automated test generation:} Executing program analysis to automatically derive tests

& \textbf{Fuzz testing:} Automated test generation method which creates sample program inputs
	&& \textbf{Generational (model-based) fuzz testing:} Fuzz testing method which creates inputs based on a predefined model
		&&& Inputs will be valid; cannot test invalid inputs
	&& \textbf{Mutational (heuristic change based) fuzz testing:} Fuzz testing method which creates inputs based modifying a test suite
		&&& Given a corpus of inputs, evolve new inputs; if the input tests a new area of the program, add it to the corpus
			&&&& Criteria can be different lines of code, more/less memory, etc.
		&&& Inputs may not necessarily be valid

& \textbf{Symbolic execution:}  Automated test generation method which replaces program inputs with symbolic values and calculates inputs based on constraints
	&& \textbf{Concolic (dynamic symbolic) traversal:} Symbolic execution where values are maintained as symbolic, then calculated at the end to reveal every possible path

& \textbf{Execution generated testing:} Symbolic execution where some values are set to be concrete

& \textbf{Execution tree:} Graph of the possible paths taken by a program
