\section{Logic-Based Coverage}
	\label{sec:logic-based-coverage}
\begin{easylist}

& \textbf{Predicate coverage:} Each boolean expression must be tested as true and false in at least one test each
& \textbf{Clause coverage:} Each clause must be tested as true and false in at least one test
& \textbf{Combinatorial/Multiple Condition coverage:} Each possible combination of clauses must be tested

& Clause determines the outcome of a predicate if changing only the value of that clause changes the outcome of the predicate

& \textbf{Modified Condition/Decision Coverage (MCDC):} Coverage demonstrating that each entry/exit is used, each decision can take every possible outcome, each clause can take every possible outcome, and each clause independently can impact the outcome
	&& Based on the behaviour how one clause affects the entire expression
	&& Ensures that each clause has an impact
	&& Not effective to generate a test suite as the drive to create minimal tests interferes with MC/DC
	&& Used to check test suites generated using other strategies

& Determining the impact of a predicate
	&& Process for a given predicate $a$:
		&&& Create two clauses, one which replaces $a$ with $\#T$ (true) and the other which replaces $a$ with $\#F$ (false)
		&&& Set these two clauses as not equal to each other
		&&& Solve the equation
		&&& If the equation is not equal, then the predicate has impact
		
	&& Example: Given $(a \land b) \lor (a \land \neg b)$, prove whether $a$ has impact or not.
		&&& Let $a = T$ for one version of the clause, and $a = F$ for another version of the clause.

		\end{easylist}
		\begin{align*}
		(T \land b) \lor (T \land \neg b)
		& \stackrel{?}{=} (F \land b) \lor (F \land \neg b) \\
		b \lor \neg b
		& \stackrel{?}{=} F \lor F \\
		T
		& \stackrel{?}{=} F
		\end{align*}
		\begin{easylist}
		
		&&& The expression evalutes to $T \neq F$. Therefore $a$ has impact.

& Process of creating a minimal test suite using MC/DC:
	&& Change all compared expressions into clauses, each represented by one predicate
	&& Create a minimal set of logical assignments where, for each predicate, there are at least two assignments where:
		&&& The values of the predicate and result both differ, and
		&&& The values of all other predicates match
	&& Create a test suite with the original inputs set to specific values to satisfy the predicate values

	&& Example: Given $a \lor (b \land c)$, generate a minimal set of tests to demonstrate MCDC coverage.
		&&& See figure~\ref{fig:mcdc-example-1}.
		&&& Test entries 1 and 2 show the impact of $a$.
		&&& Test entries 2 and 3 show the impact of $b$.
		&&& Test entries 3 and 4 show the impact of $c$.

		&&& See figure~\ref{fig:mcdc-example-2}.
		&&& Test entries 1 and 2 show the impact of $a$.
		&&& Test entries 2 and 3 show the impact of $d$.
