\section{Performance}
	\label{sec:performance}
\begin{easylist}

& Performance areas include:
	&& Speed/runtime
	&& Resource management
	&& Throughput
	&& Responsiveness
	
& Analyzed differently depending on component granularity (e.g. system-level, instruction-level)

& Strategies of measuring performance:
	&& Identify area of interest

& Evaluating results:
	&& Be aware of:
		&&& Warm-up time
		&&& Caching
	&& Measure and compare across changes
	&& Run many executions and take the average
	
& Measurement of results:

	&& \textbf{Arithmetic mean:} Average of measurements which measure the same value
		&&& Equation:
\begin{equation}
\frac{ \displaystyle \sum_{i=1}^N r_i }{N}
\end{equation}

	&& \textbf{Harmonic mean:} Average of measurements which report rates (e.g. throughput for multiple tasks)
		&&& Represents the constant rate required for the same amount of time
		&&& Calculated by dividing the total number of rates by the rate per unit (inversion of the rate)
		&&& Equation:
\begin{equation}
\frac{N}{ \displaystyle \sum_{i=1}^N \frac{1}{r_i} }
\end{equation}
	&& \textbf{Geometric mean:} Average of measurements which represent different values
		&&& A change in any benchmark affects the final value proportionally
		&&& Represents a multiplied score of performance
		&&& Equation:
\begin{equation}
\sqrt[N]{ \prod_{i=1}^N r_i }
\end{equation}
	&& \textbf{Standard deviation:} Measure of confidence in the mean
		&&& Large values imply needing more samples or correction of methodological error
