\section{Program Analysis}
	\label{sec:program-analysis}
\begin{easylist}

& \textbf{Program analysis:} Tools and techniques which automatically analyze software behaviour

& \textbf{Dynamic analysis:} Analysis about a single instance of program execution
	&& Can be computationally expensive
	&& Does not examine all possible executions

& \textbf{Static analysis:} Analysis on source code about all possible executions
	&& Undecidability prevents some analyses
	&& \textbf{Abstract interpretation:} Static analysis method which simulates different execution paths

& False positives/negatives may occur

& Examples:
	&& Valgrind: Dynamic binary instrumentation tool to check for memory leaks
		&&& Only works on executables which provide both stack and heap allocated memory
	&& Clang sanitizers: Compile-time instrumentation tools to analyze safety of usage

\end{easylist}
