\begin{easylist}


& \textbf{Property-based testing:} Testing which generates tests to evaluate functional properties/requirements
	&& Mathematical representation of an expectation

& Common test strategies:
	&& \textbf{Symmetry:} Test strategy where operations are performed to return to the original value
	&& \textbf{Alternative:} Test strategy where a value is compared with a value generated from alternative solutions
	&& \textbf{Induction:} Test strategy
	&& \textbf{Idempotence:} Test strategy where performing an operation more than once has no effect
	&& \textbf{Invariant:} Test strategy where a property of a preprocessed value must be equal to the property of a processed value
