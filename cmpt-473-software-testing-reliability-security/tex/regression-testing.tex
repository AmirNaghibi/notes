\section{Regression Testing}
	\label{sec:regression-testing}
\begin{easylist}

& \textbf{Regression testing:} Method of testing which ensures previous functionality is preserved, supporting change

& Unexpected behaviour can be caused by:
	&& New environments
	&& Modifying other components

& Regression test suite is a subset of the test suite

& Components are tests for:
	&& Previously fixed bugs
	&& Units
	&& System

& Upon a failing test, one or more of the following should occur:
	&& Fix the software bug
	&& Fix stale test inputs
	&& Change expected behaviour

\end{easylist}
\subsection{Managing Test Suite Size}
	\label{subsec:regression-testing:managing-test-suite-size}
\begin{easylist}

& Limit regression test suite size by preventing redundant tests (e.g. not useful behaviour, not covered by adequacy criteria)

& Choosing a subset of tests:
	&& Conservative approach: Run all tests
	&& Cheap approach: Run tests which have requirements relating to the modified lines
	&& Middle ground approach: Run tests affected by how changes propagate by software
		&&& \textbf{Change impact analysis:} Identification of how a change affects other components

\end{easylist}
