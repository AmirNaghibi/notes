\begin{easylist}

& \textbf{Security:} Maintainance of desired properties against the presence of adversaries

& \textbf{CIA model:} Model of classic security properties
	&& \textbf{Confidentiality:} Security property where information is only available to those authorized to access it
		&&& E.g. Information leaks violate confidentiality of information
	&& \textbf{Integrity:} Security property where information can only be modified by authorized entities in permitted ways
		&&& E.g. Data corruption removes data integrity
	&& \textbf{Access:} Security property where those authorized for access are not prevented
		&&& E.g. Denial of service attacks remove access from legitimate users

& Inability to test all points creates an attack surface

& MITRE's categories of security vulnerabilities: Insecure interaction, risky resource management, porous defenses

& Buffer overflows can overwrite other code in the stack
	&& \textbf{Stack canary:} Indicator of compromised stack memory which exists between the return address and frame pointer, and aborts the program if it is overwritten
	&& \textbf{Data Execution Prevention:} Technique which only allows execution of code from an allowed area

& \textbf{Return to libc attack:} Attack which replaces critical code which must be executed
	&& E.g. Replacement of a return address with a pointer to a new, compromised function
	&& \textbf{Return-oriented programming:} Manipulation of function pointers and stack memory to execute various components of existing functions

& \textbf{Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR):} Randomized placement of function and stack data to prevent data manipulation and execution redirection

& \textbf{Control flow integrity:} Technique which restricts program execution to only allowed areas

& Memory safety vulnerabilities:
	&& Potential causes:
		&&& Out-of-bounds pointers
		&&& Dangling pointers
	&& Use tools/abstractions which avoid thse issues

& SQL injections

& CIA can be violated by inferring information
	&& \textbf{Side channel attack:} Attach which infers system information based on information details
	&& Leaks from logs, output, timing, power, sound, light, etc.
	&& Difference in behaviour/cache retrieval upon sensitive information can create difference in timing

& \textbf{Access control policies:} Rules which specify who can access certain information
	&& \textbf{Discretionary access control:} Access control policies where the owner determines access within their own domain
	&& \textbf{Mandatory access control:} Access control policies where the operating system determines access to resources
