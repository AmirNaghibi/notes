\section{Types of Testing}
	\label{sec:types-of-testing}
\begin{easylist}

& Test cases:
	&& Require an input and expected output/state/behaviour
	&& \textbf{Oracle:} Evaluation of the output/behaviour of a test
	&& \textbf{Mock:} Entity which is used to measure or examine behaviour
	&& \textbf{Stub:} Fake entity which is used during testing to replace a component

& If external state is uncontrolled, tests will be nondeterministic
	&& Factors causing lack of control:
		&&& Lack of isolation
		&&& Asynchronous behavior
		&&& Remote services
		&&& Time
		&&& Resource leaks

& \textbf{Coverage/adequacy:} Measurement of how well a test suite addresses quality criteria

& \textbf{Test Driven Development (TDD)}: Software testing where unit tests are created first and used to drive development

& \textbf{Unit testing}: Software testing of the smallest possible components
	&& Principles include component isolation, simplicity, ease of understanding

& \textbf{Integration testing}: Software testing based on the connection of multiple components

& \textbf{Acceptance testing}: Software testing based on acceptance criteria

& \textbf{Black-box testing:} Software testing based on the external input specification of a system
	&& Involves \hyperref[sec:input-space-partitioning]{input space partitioning}
& \textbf{White-box testing:} Software testing based on the internal program structure of a system
	&& Involves \hyperref[sec:graph-coverage]{graph coverage}

& \textbf{Fuzz testing:} Method of exploratory software testing which inputs randomly mutated data into a program to evaluate random inputs

& Test scenarios can be concrete (e.g. $x = 5$) or abstract (e.g. for all $x$, $x > 0$)
	&& Abstract test cases can generate a test and check the oracle, using:
		&&& Testing with randomly generated values
		&&& Symbolic execution

& Testing strategies which evaluate the existing test suite for effectiveness:
	&& MC/DC
	&& Mutation testing
