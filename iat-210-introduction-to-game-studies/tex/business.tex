		&& Money from family/friends
			&&& Will quickly dry up
		&& Crowdfunding through networks such as Kickstarter
		&& Government programs
	& Types of company funding:
		&& \emph{Incubator:} Company which provides management training, guidance, office space, and other services to startup companies

\subsection{Business Models of Game Types}
	\label{subsec:business:business-models-of-game-types}
\begin{easylist}

	& Casual games:
		&& Lower costs spur early development
		&& Initial organic audience growth
		&& Greater attention leads to monetization
		&& Creates early returns due to easy scaling
		&& E.g. Zynga, Big Fish
		
	& Indie games:
		&& For an overview of indie games, see subsection~\ref{subsec:types-of-games:indie-games}
		&& Not always successful
		&& Relies on discoverability by the intended audience
		&& Compared to the mainstream game industry:
			&&& Less hit-driven
			&&& Small successes/failures are more relevant
		&& Developers need to be smart business people and marketers
		&& Raising money:
			&&& Tradeoff between time spent:
				&&&& Raising money
				&&&& Developing the game
			&&& `Raise only what you need, but raise enough'

\end{easylist}
\subsection{The Company}
	\label{subsec:business:the-company}
\begin{easylist}
		
	& Industries are discovering that making a great business is different from making a good game

	& \emph{Unicorn company:} Ideal company which utilizes a small team and big ideas to quickly make a continuously profitable product/line
		&& `Jewels' of Silicon Valley
			&&& Rarely works elsewhere; some of its properties don't create much traction
				&&&& E.g. Minimum Viable Product (MVP): Idea of creating a product which has the minimum required features to fulfil its purpose, in order to minimize costs
		&& Can hit a pre-public valuation of \$1 billion
		&& Nearly impossible to find
		&& Increasing numbers
			&&& Causing worries about the tech bubble popping
		&& E.g. Hootsuite, Slack
		
	& \emph{Rhino company:} Company which is well-rounded, realistic, and works through problems and failures at a slower, more reasonable pace
		&& Ugly, bulky, but have staying power
		&& Has more chances to pivot (change focus/direction) to find a product-market fit
		&& Being in a secondary market means a lower run-rate (spending over time)
		
	& `Think like a unicorn, work like a rhino'
		&& Starting a new venture is notoriously difficult
		&& Failures do not mean you cannot succeed
