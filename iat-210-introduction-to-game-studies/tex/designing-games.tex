\subsection{General Game Design}
	\label{subsec:designing-games:general-game-design}
\begin{easylist}

	& Game mechanics:
		&& Add verbs/actions to increase the number of mechanical interactions
			&&& Allow actions to act on more objects
		&& Add nouns/objects
	& Ensure flow:
		&& Create small, achievable goals and manageable challenges
		&& Write clear rules
		&& Give immediate feedback
		
	& Allow game goals to be achieved through multiple gameplay gestalts (see subsection~\ref{subsec:the-players-perspective:gameplay-gestalts})
	
	& Balance:
		&& Cake-cutting example: Two people share a slice of cake. One person cuts the slice in half, the other person chooses who gets which slice.
			&&& Cutter has an incentive to cut the slice as fairly as possible
			&&& Ensures fairness and does not enable cheating

\end{easylist}
\subsection{Designing Rules}
	\label{subsec:designing-games:designing-rules}
\begin{easylist}
	
	& Designing rules:
		&& Designed iteratively with trial and error
		&& Order:
			&&& Create operational rules
			&&& Create foundational rules and ensure game balance
			&&& Use playtesting and iteration to cover every circumstance possible
			&&& Create written rules

\end{easylist}
