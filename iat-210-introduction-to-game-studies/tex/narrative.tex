\section{Narrative}
	\label{sec:narrative}
\begin{easylist}

	& \emph{Story:} Experience bounded in time with a beginning, middle, and end (in any order)
	& Examples of narrative frameworks:
		&& 3-act structure
		&& Hero's journey
		&& Non-linear stories
	& Types of story designs:
		&& \emph{Classical design:}
			&&& Active protagonist
			&&& Struggle against external forces
			&&& Continuous time
			&&& Consistent reality
			&&& Closed ending
		&& \emph{Minimalist structure:}
			&&& Passive protagonist
			&&& Struggle against internal forces
			&&& Consistent reality
			&&& Open ending
		&& \emph{Antiplot narrative:}
			&&& Non-linear time
			&&& Inconsistent reality
			&&& Chance and coincidence are prevalent
	& \emph{Run, Lola, Run:} Movie by Tom Twyker from 1998
		&& Combines elements of all 3 story design types
		&& Can be thought of as a narrative database from which many stories could be told
		&& Utilizes common film conventions such as:
			&&& Flashbacks
			&&& Foreshadowing
			&&& Hand-held filming
			&&& Animation
			&&& Supernatural elements
			&&& \emph{Maguffin:} Motivator which a character pursues with little or no narrative explanation/reason
		&& Characteristics of classical design:
			&&& Active protagonist - Lola runs to her father for money
			&&& Struggle against external forces: Time, the hobo with the money, the police
			&&& Continuous time in each part
			&&& Closed ending - death of either, or both surviving
		&& Characteristics of non-linear films:
			&&& Time repeats and events change
			&&& Choice and coincidence from small changes
			&&& ``Hero's Journey'':
				&&&& Coined by Joseph Campbell in the book \emph{The Hero with a Thousand Faces}
				&&&& Made more accessible (adapted to film) by Christopher Vogler
				&&&& Use of recognizable and universal archetypes (e.g. threshold guardians, tricksters, mentors)
		&& Similarities to a video game:
			&&& Having `lives' or starting over with a new/better strategy
			&&& Bounded game space - city of Berlin
			
	& \emph{Narrative gestalt:} How a game and its story are connected and influence each other
		&& How the story emerges from the game based on your actions and choices
