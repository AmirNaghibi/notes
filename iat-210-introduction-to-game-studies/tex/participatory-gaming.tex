\subsection{Subculture}
	\label{subsec:participatory-gaming:subculture}
\begin{easylist}

	& \emph{Subculture:} Culture within (usually a rejection of) a mainstream culture
	& Maintains basic mainstream culture attributes but changes attitudes, values, interests, terminology, music, art, etc.
	& Primarily demonstrated by teens and young adults
	& Forming a tight in-group and rejecting those who do not adopt the same values
	& \emph{In-group:} Cohesive social group that members identify with, and members associate with other members
		&& \emph{In-group bias:} In-group members favour in-group members over others
	& \emph{Out-group:} Any person who a member of an in-group does not identify with
		&& \emph{Out-group bias:} In-group members are hostile towards out-group members
	& \emph{Poseur:} Person who adopts subculture identifiers for acceptance into the group, but does not truly recognize the core values of the group
		&& Perceived as inauthentic
				
	& Nerd subculture:
		&& \emph{Nerd:} Person obsessed with obscure or unpopular hobbies
		&& Formed around 'nerdy' hobbies and interests such as video games, anime, comic books, etc.
		&& Looser than other subcultures

		&& History and growth:
				
			&&& Once mocked, now proud and celebrated in popular culture
			&&& Became mainstream due to the internet, and its facilitation of communication through groups dedicated to specific topics:
				&&&& BBS and Usenet:
					&&&&& Exchange of ideas
					&&&&& Small audience, little exposure to new ideas/interests
				&&&& Forums:
					&&&&& Indexed by search engines
					&&&&& Very small subcultures
			&&& Web 2.0 allowed massive social media and content-sharing websites (e.g. Facebook, 4chan, Tumblr, Reddit)
				&&&& No dedicated discussion topic
				&&&& Extremely rapid and diverse exchange of ideas and content to a wide audience
				&&&& Allowed discussion of taboo hobbies and topics
				&&&& Helped expose nerd culture
						
		&& Identification:
			&&& Clothing includes body modifications and tattoos, cosplay, media references, etc.
			&&& Discussion on video games, internet culture, etc.
			&&& Conventions allow for physical sharing of interests
				
		&& Physical games such as DnD, MtG, board games, etc.
		&& Multiplayer gameplay such as LAN parties, MMORPGs, eSports
		&& Specific interest meetups
			
		&& Values and aspirations:
			&&& Intelligence and intellectual pursuits
			&&& Gameplay skill
			&&& Up-to-date regarding nerdy topics
			&&& Employment as a software or game developer
			&&& Success in participatory gameplay
		&& New subculture members sometimes rejected by 'veterans' due to bitterness prior to nerd acceptance
			
		&& Threats - e.g. Gamergate: Scandal in which a female game developer was accused of manipulating others to become more powerful/famous
		&& Popular culture:
			&&& Many are upset with how people who once marginalized them now glorify them
			&&& Threats by cultural appropriation:
				&&&& Breaks the boundary between the gamers' world and the mainstream world
				&&&& E.g. Mass-marketed merchandise, popularity of widely-palatable non-casual games, etc.

\subsection{Streaming Gameplay}
	\label{subsec:participatory-gaming:streaming-gameplay}
\begin{easylist}

	& Callois described how mimicry vs agency, fantasy fulfillment, and looking up to a skilled person create an interest in watching others play games

	& eSports:
		&& Builds on this shared interest
		&& Changed from amateur to highly professional
			&&& E.g. Some universities offer scholarships to professional gamers
		&& Most popular game genres: MOBA, FPS, RTS, fighting
		&& Statistics:
			&&& League of Legends: 1300 tournaments
			&&& DOTA 2: 300 tournaments
			&&& StarCraft: 2200 tournaments
		&& Celebrities/online personalities:
			&&& Defined by low production values and a niche audience
			&&& Often humorous
			&&& Empowered by social video sites such as YouTube
			&&& Traditional media is challenged and threatened by this because they cannot control it or its growth
			&&& E.g. PewDiePie:
				&&&& Millions of subscribers
				&&&& Popularized games such as Flappy Bird and Goat Simulator simply by playing them in his videos						
						
	& Twitch TV: Website where people can stream live gameplay
		&& Fundamentally a second screen experience; no need to actively play to interact
		&& Fourth largest provider of online video behind Netflix, YouTube, Hulu
		&& 100 million unique users per month
		&& Purchased by Amazon for \$970 million
		&& Shares best practices for gamers and content creators
		&& Game industry is attempting to appeal to the same audience via:
			&&& Game optimization
			&&& Live events
			&&& Sponsorships
			&&& Celebrity engagement
			&&& Spectator modes
			&&& Contrasted with Bell Media in Canada, which is raising TV fees, blocking content, violating net neutrality, and fighting Netflix
		&& Raises questions about how to value this media, how to deal with legal/copyright issues, what constitutes as intellectual property, etc.
