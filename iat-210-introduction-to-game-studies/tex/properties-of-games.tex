\section{Properties of Games}
	\label{sec:properties-of-games}
\subsection{Games Today}
	\label{subsec:properties-of-games:games-today}
\begin{easylist}

	& Consist of:
		&& Hardware and software components (generally)
			&&& Use a device/platform
		&& Immediate interaction
		&& Data-driven experiences
		&& Increasing complexities
	& Are designed for a specific player personae (see subsection~\ref{subsec:the-audience:player-personae})
	& Are classified and analyzed by genre (see subsection~\ref{subsec:types-of-games:genres})
	& Are created by designers with motives (see section~\ref{sec:reasons-for-game-design})
	& Can have a narrative aspect (see section~\ref{sec:narrative})

\end{easylist}
\subsection{Attributes of Games}
	\label{subsec:properties-of-games:attributes-of-games}
\begin{easylist}

	& A game has:
		&& A winning condition
		&& Mechanics defined by objects, attributes, and actions
		&& Rules to set bounds and show how mechanics lead to the winning condition

	& Game axes:
		&& Rules/play
		&& Casual/hardcore
		&& Challenge/flow
		&& Ludology/storytelling
		&& Uniqueness
			
	& \emph{Fourteen Forms of Fun} by Pierre-Alexandre Garneau
		&& Beauty, immersion, problem solving, competition, social interaction, comedy, \\ thrills/danger, phyiscal activity, love, creation, power discovery, advancement, using an ability
		
	& \emph{Agency:} Autonomy of a player within the constraints of the game
	& \emph{Resources:} Properties which the player may use and control to complete tasks
		&& Provide a goal or incentive
		&& E.g. Money, health/energy, time, space/territory, inventory
		
	& \emph{Fog of war:} Player(s) have limited knowledge about the state of the game
		&& E.g. In StarCraft, any area without the player's troops is darkened and does not show enemy troops
		
\end{easylist}
\subsection{Game Boundaries and Gamespaces}
	\label{subsec:properties-of-games:game-boundaries-and-gamespaces}
\begin{easylist}

	& Game boundaries / gamespace:
		&& Created when players decide that the game begins
		&& \emph{Magic circle:} Finite space with infinite possibilities which sets the mood, tone, and boundaries
			&&& Marks boundary of the game space concretely or abstractly
			&&& Defines an enclosed, separate, temporary space
			&&& Contains the role-playing and experimentation
			&&& Breaking the magic circle ends the game
			&&& E.g. Loading a game into a system and seeing logos, music, and menus
			&&& Examples in other contexts:
				&&&& Lights dimming and trailers appearing in a movie theatre to prepare for the showing of the movie
				&&&& Opening ceremonies to gather attention and a feeling of having begun a special period
		&& \emph{Frame:} Boundary which signifies that a game is being played
			&&& Separate from the real world
			&&& Psychological; can have physical components
		&& \emph{Lusory attitude:} Being in the `mood' to play a game
		&& \emph{Discrete gamespace:} Play where the moves are restricted to a certain set
		&& \emph{Continuous gamespace:} Play where the moves are free and generally unlimited
		&& \emph{Bound:} Boundary or restriction of the  physical gamespace
		&& \emph{Subspace:}	Separate area of play which is governed by slightly different rules and conventions
			&&& E.g. Penalty shots in hockey
		
\end{easylist}
\subsection{Game Mechanics}
	\label{subsec:properties-of-games:game-mechanics}
\begin{easylist}

	& \emph{Game mechanic:} Factor which gives a reward when a certain action happens
		&& Creates contraints which are concrete, interesting, repeatable, and fun
		&& Determines the methods of playing/winning
		&& Creates a difficulty scale
		&& Incorporates the game's flavour
		&& Logical or illogical as required
		&& May be an object, attribute, or action
	& \emph{Object}: Character, prop, token, or other 'physical' component of a game
		&& Noun of mechanical analysis
		&& One or more attributes
			
	& \emph{Attribute:} Property of an object
		&& Detail of mechanical analysis
		&& Static or dynamic; inherent or customizable
			&&& Design needs to know how and when states change
		&& Degree of transparency of attributes affects gameplay
		&& Increase through levelling up/gaining experience
		&& E.g. In \emph{World of Warcraft}, the basic building blocks of a character are:
			&&& Primary: Strength, agility, intellect, stamina etc.
			&&& Secondary: Damage absorption, armour class, spell power, etc.
		&& E.g. In \emph{Need for Speed}, the specifications of your car are:
			&&& Primary: Speed, acceleration, control, strength, durability, etc.
			&&& Secondary: Colour, manufacturer, make, etc.
			
	& \emph{Action:} Verb of mechanical analysis
		&& \emph{Operative action:} Basic, simple action which the player can take
		&& \emph{Resultant action:} Action taken in pursuit of a broader goal
		&& The greater the `operative-resultant ratio', the more unique ways to win

\end{easylist}
\subsection{Rules}
	\label{subsec:properties-of-games:rules}
\begin{easylist}

	& \emph{Rule:} Statement which defines the relationship between players, goals, mechanics, and the game space
		&& Binding; limits player action
		&& Explicit and unambiguous
		&& Shared by all players
		&& Fixed
	& \emph{Operational rule:} Rule which describes how the game is played in general
	& \emph{Foundational rule:} Rule which describes the underlying formal structure of the game
		&& Often tracked in physical games with items such as dice, chips, and game boards
	& \emph{Behavioural rule:} Rule which specifies a social contract between players
		&& Preserving the magic circle
		&& Sportsmanship
	& \emph{Written rule:} Precise documentation which specifies the operative actions
	& \emph{Tournament rule:} Rule which specifies how the game should be played competitively
		&& Eliminates ambiguity
		&& Creates a level playing field
	& \emph{Advisory rule:} Tip or strategy to optimize gameplay
	& \emph{House rule:} Rule created by particular groups of players to suit circumstances or preferences
	
	& Digital games allow for faster, more enjoyable, and more complex gameplay due to being able to enforce rules objectively and almost instantaneously

	& See \emph{Designing Rules}, subsection~\ref{subsec:designing-games:designing-rules}

\end{easylist}
