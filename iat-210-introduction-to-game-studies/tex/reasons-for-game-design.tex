\section{Reasons for Game Design}
	\label{sec:reasons-for-game-design}
\begin{easylist}
				
	& Schell's 4 types of game designers:
		&& \emph{Persuasives:} Game designers who create games to fulfill a third-party goal
			&&& See \emph{Gamification and Motivational Design}, subsection~\ref{subsec:reasons-for-game-design:gamification-and-motivational-design}
		&& \emph{Humanitarians:} Game designers who design games for a greater good
			&&& See \emph{The Impact of Games on the World}, subsection~\ref{subsec:reasons-for-game-design:the-impact-of-games-on-the-world}
		&& \emph{Fulfillers:} Game designers who create games for gamers
		&& \emph{Artists/Indies:} Game designers who create games as a form of artistic expression
			&&& See \emph{Indie Games}, subsection~\ref{subsec:types-of-games:indie-games}

\end{easylist}
\subsection{Gamification and Motivational Design}
	\label{subsec:reasons-for-game-design:gamification-and-motivational-design}
\begin{easylist}

	& \emph{Gamification:} Application of game design conventions such as competitions and rewards to non-game activities
		&& Adds fun and engagement
		&& Wide range of potential applications (e.g. fitness, personal finances)
		&& Most people and hardcore gamers want different things
		&& Is enabled by:
			&&& A cultural framework which is friendly towards games
			&&& More people playing more games on an increasing range of devices
			&&& Tracking technology, web analytics, cultural momentum
		&& In today's world, gamification:
			&&& Has shifted the design of experiences towards pleasure
			&&& New developments engage with the user, are quicker to market, are cheaper to create, etc.
			&&& Is mostly driven by marketing teams
			&&& Relies on extrinsic motivators and non-fun ideas such as savings and status
		&& Somewhat controversial
			&&& Counter-argument - Ian Bogost's paper on \emph{Schell Games}:
				&&&& Refers to such experiences as exploitation-ware
				&&&& Questions whether measurable outcomes matter more than true player motivation
				&&&& Questions whether it is okay for incentives to muddy meaningful player agency
				
	& \emph{Motivational design:} Game design around giving the player a reason to play, which benefis both the player and designer
		&& Coined by Sebastian Deterding
			&&& Understand the difference between intrinsic and extrinsic motivation when we structure experiences to engage
			&&& Internalization can occur through the application of positive reinforcement; externalization can happen when rewards are applied heavily to an experience
			&&& Problem occurs when extrinsic factors are applied without taking into account the user questioning benefits for themselves
				
	& \emph{Self-determination:} Why people choose what they choose, when they are free to choose
		&& Field of psychology that has only recently been considered empirically valid
		&& Explains the three universal needs of a gamified experience:
			&&& \emph{Confidence:} Mastery of a pursuit
				&&&& See \emph{agon}, subsection~\ref{subsec:types-of-games:types-of-play}
			&&& \emph{Autonomy:} Control and self-direction
				&&&& See \emph{agency}, subsection~\ref{subsec:properties-of-games:attributes-of-games}
			&&& \emph{Relatedness:} Positive social environment and/or motivational climate
				&&& E.g. Twitch, nerd culture, fitness clubs
	& Pursuit of pleasure:
		&& Some play games to seek pleasure; some play games as social obligations (e.g. FarmVille, grinding)
		&& Some games shift motivations from pleasure-seeking to another motivator
		&& See \emph{14 Forms of Fun}, subsection~\ref{subsec:properties-of-games:attributes-of-games}

	& Motivationally designed experiences must:
		&& Hold strong appeal from the pleasure centre
		&& Engage with the intended user to encourage return
		&& Require minimal effort to play
		&& Disallow gaming of the system
		&& Not be embarrassing to peers
		&& Questions to ask about the application of gamification:
			&&& How to define the form of fun for an experience
			&&& Whether the intended users will enjoy the experience
			&&& How to ensure traits become more and more prevalent through repetition
			&&& How to create the right mix between intrinsic and extrinsic rewards
			&&& Whether it reinforces the business goal

\subsection{The Impact of Games on the World}
	\label{subsec:reasons-for-game-design:the-impact-of-games-on-the-world}
\begin{easylist}

	& Some believe games can create a better world, partially due to the proliferation of games in society
	& Some believe that solving imaginary problems in virtual worlds is mostly unproductive
	
	& Jane McGonigal:
		&& Game designer and theorist
		&& Believes that intrinsically motivated gameplay can lead to collective benefits for society
		&& Gamers are learning:
			&&& \emph{Urgent optimism:} Ability to act immediately to overcome a problem
			&&& \emph{Epic meaning:} Wanting to be a part of a larger purpose
			&&& Blissful productivity
			&&& Social skills
		&& Created a game named SuperBetter:
			&&& Adapts the challenge/reward structure of games
			&&& Helps players solve their own real-life problems such as obesity, depression, getting a job, asthma, etc.
			
	& Challenge is to find a way to use games to harness creative and productive energy
	& See \emph{Serious Games}, subsection~\ref{subsec:types-of-games:serious-games}
