\section{The Player's Perspective}
	\label{sec:the-players-perspective}
\begin{easylist}
	
	& \emph{Natural advantage:} A skill or ability not directly related to the game which gives a player an upper-hand
		&& Unrelated to:
			&&& Knowledge of the game
			&&& Familiarity of the game's strategy or gameplay	
	
\end{easylist}
\subsection{Choices and Payoffs}
	\label{subsec:the-players-perspective:choices-and-payoffs}
\begin{easylist}

	& Choices in games can be modeled through payoff matrices
		&& E.g. Prisoner's Dilemma:
		\begin{quote}
		Two criminals are apprehended for a crime and are pressured to confess in isolation. If a prisoner defects, he is promised an easier sentence. If they cooperate by maintaining silence, they will both receive a heavier sentence.
		\end{quote}
		&& Payoffs:
			&&& \emph{Temptation payoff:} Winning at the other person's expense
			&&& \emph{Reward payoff:} Both players win by cooperating, but very little
			&&& \emph{Punishment payoff:} Both players lose for trying to cheat each other
			&&& \emph{Sucker payoff:} Losing due to trying to do the right thing, and the other person trying to cheat you

\end{easylist}
\subsection{Gameplay Gestalts}
	\label{subsec:the-players-perspective:gameplay-gestalts}
\begin{easylist}

	& \emph{Gameplay gestalt:} Personal strategy/pattern of actions allowing players to progress
		&& \emph{Emergent actions:} Subset of all possible actions driven by unique player strategies and created by the available mechanics
		&& Many games have numerous emergent patterns which appeal to different player psychologies
		&& May use exploits in a game
		
\end{easylist}
\subsection{Reward and Addiction}
	\label{subsec:the-players-perspective:reward-and-addiction}
\begin{easylist}

	& \emph{Reward:} Positive reinforcement for a goal-oriented behaviour
		&& Biologically modulated by dopamine
		&& In games:
			&&& Common; easy to earn
			&&& Short-term
			&&& Allows social comparison
			&&& E.g. Achievements, leveling up, daily quests, unlockable content, rare items and collections
			&&& 4 main types of reward-oriented behaviour:
				&&&& Exploring
				&&&& Collecting
				&&&& Achieving
				&&&& Killing
	& \emph{Addiction:} Excessive or compulsive repetition of an activity
		&& Can be created through high-frequency, low-effort rewards
		&& Directly linked to behaviours such as:
			&&& Craving
			&&& Tolerance
			&&& Withdrawal
			&&& Loss of control
			&&& Neglect of other activities
		&& Consequences of MMO play:
			&&& Negative:
				&&&& Lower psychological well-being
				&&&& Worse life outcomes
				&&&& Lower self-esteem
				&&&& Greater aggressiveness
			&&& Positive:
				&&&& In-game friendships and connections
				&&&& Teamwork
				&&&& Group identity
				&&&& Social interaction and immersion
		&& Treatment:
			&&& Online support forums
			&&& Therapy
			&&& Medication
