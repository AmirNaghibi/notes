\begin{easylist}

	& \emph{Man, Play, and Games} by Roger Callois
		&& Modes of play:
			&&& \emph{Ludus:} Structured play created with the idea of discipline, training, and boundaries
				&&&& Based on patience, skill, and/or ingenuity

\end{easylist}
\subsection{Social Games}
	\label{subsec:types-of-games:social-games}
\begin{easylist}

	& Began with brower-based games played and social networks to link such games
		&& Increased in popularity due to companies such as Zynga, Playfish, etc.
	& Involve gameplay requiring cooperation and interaction
		&& \emph{Asynchronous gameplay:} Players do not have to play the game at the same time to have an interactive experience
	
\end{easylist}
\subsection{Mobile Games}
	\label{subsec:types-of-games:mobile-games}
\begin{easylist}

	& Defined by their device(s), which:
		&& Are low-powered
		&& Have a small screen
		&& Are different from portable game devices
	& Allow for interrupted gameplay
	& Focus on mechanics over graphics or story
	
	& History:
		&& Periodic and bumpy
		&& Global market:
			&&& 2005: \$2.6 billion
			&&& 2014: \$10.3 billion
			
		&& Late 1990s:
			&&& Began to emerge
			&&& Constrained by hardware and software limitations
			&&& Defined a new mode of play
			&&& E.g. Tetris, Snake
			
		&& Early 2000s:
			&&& Nokia releaseed the N-Gage phone which:
				&&&& Awkwardly changed the form factor of the phone to suit gaming
				&&&& Attempted to bring big ideas to a small screen
				&&&& Only sold 3 million units
				&&&& Was rebranded as a service rather than hardware
				&&&& Ended sales in 2010
				&&&& Successful games: Pathway to Glory, Rifts
			&&& Apple developed the iTunes system which:
				&&&& Provided:
					&&&&& Automatically downloadable and extendable content
					&&&&& `Frictionless' publishing by third parties
				&&&& Was a surprise hit
				&&&& Established microtransactions as a new consumer behaviour
					&&&&& Enabled proliferation of free/lite games
					
	& Business models:
		&& Ad-supported and/or free
		&& \emph{Freemium:} Game which is essentially free, but requires payment to make any significant progress
		&& Paid
		&& Pay-to-win
		
	& \emph{Kim Kardashian: Hollywood}
		&& Developed by Glu
		&& Simple; linear
		&& Uses a mobile RPG engine reskinned with a Kardashian theme
		&& Freemium:
			&&& Free to download and play
			&&& Not fun and quite difficult by default
			&&& Progress speeds up and fun increases when players pay
		&& Great alignment with Kardashian's fanbase
			&&& Smartpone addicts
			&&& Heavy use of social media
		&& Strong brand alignment which links with other Kardashian media properties
		&& Business statistics (over 3 months):
			&&& 22 million downloads
			&&& \$43 million earned
			&&& 5.7 billion minutes played
	
\end{easylist}
\subsection{Indie Games}
	\label{subsec:types-of-games:indie-games}
\begin{easylist}

	& \emph{Indie game:} Game created by a small-scale developer (individual or team) with little financial support
	
	& Developed from the shareware movement of the 1990s
		&& Technology and tools became more broadly accessible
		&& Increasingly bizzare and uniquegames developed
	& For the developer(s), creating an indie game is:
		&& Personally fulfilling
		&& Not necessarily financially rewarding
		&& A great way to put ideas into practice with little downside
		&& Free of constraints imposed by big budgets, big publishers, etc. to allow for a wide range of experiementation in gameplay/styles
	& A business first and foremost
	& Industry is driven by summits, festivals, game jams
	& Development of open distribution platforms means that indie games will continue to have a future
	& E.g. Minecraft, Super Meat Boy, Mountain
	& For information on the business of indie games, see subsection~\ref{subsec:business:business-models-of-game-types}
	
\end{easylist}
\subsection{Serious Games}
	\label{subsec:types-of-games:serious-games}
\begin{easylist}

	& \emph{Serious game:} Game which attempts to convey a social/moral message to a specific audience
	& E.g. SimEarth, Points of Entry, World Without Oil, September 12\textsuperscript{th}
	& Seek to affect their audience through:
		&& Empowering
		&& Persuading
		&& Educating
		&& Converting
		&& Subverting
		&& Training
	& Do not include:
		&& Education + entertainment games (e.g. typing games)
		&& Education/learning games
		&& Simulations
	& Have a target audience of:
		&& Students
		&& \emph{Barometric citizen:} Someone who potentially may have a great impact
		&& Certain consumers
	& Are models which provide entertaining solutions to real world problems
	
	& Ian Bogost:
		&& Games are models we create
		&& Through designing a game, we impose rules
		&& Rules define roles for players
		&& Player roles lead to understanding or empathy
		&& Understanding is linked to the context of the game and creates meaningful insight
	& E.g. \emph{September 12\textsuperscript{th}} using Bogost's model:
		&& Models a war in the Middle East
		&& Rules consist of having the ability to fire down delayed missiles at civilians and terrorists
		&& Role is the player in the air killing the people
		&& Understanding that killing the 'bad guys' is not so simple
		&& Context is the current war in Iraq
	& \emph{Militainment:} Simulating war in a game to affect a player's thinking
		&& US Military \emph{Doom} mod
			&&& Created 1996
			&&& Used for squad-based training
		&& \emph{America's Army:} First-person shooter designed to recruit youths
			&&& Created by the US Military
			&&& Self-proclaimed propaganda
			&&& Gamified recruiting tool
				&&&& Embodies core values of soldiers
				&&&& Identifies and indoctrinates promising youth while weeding those who would be a bad fit
				&&&& Effective ROI (return on investment)
		&& \emph{Medal of Honor} controversy:
			&&& Players could play as the enemy in the Middle East
			&&& Some were displeased that people could play as the 'enemy'
		&& \emph{This War of Mine:} Survival game where the player has to live as a civilian in a war zone
			&&& Focuses on civilians rather than soldiers
			&&& Created to show life during the siege of Sarajevo
			&&& Survival sub-genre of adventure games
			&&& Using Bogost's model:
				&&&& Models the reality of the civilians behind the soldiers
				&&&& Rules govern possible survival strategies
				&&&& Role is to keep the family alive until the siege ends
				&&&& Understanding is built through choice and moral dilemma
				&&&& Context is a war in a civilian area
