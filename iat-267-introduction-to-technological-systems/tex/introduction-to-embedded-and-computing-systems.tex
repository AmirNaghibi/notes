\section{Introduction to Embedded and Computing Systems}
	\label{sec:introduction-to-embedded-and-computing-systems}
\begin{easylist}

	& \emph{Hardware:} Physical components of a digital system
	& \emph{Software:} Electronically stored instructions of a digital system

	& \emph{Embedded system:} System which interacts with another system and/or other components
		&& Components:
			&&& \emph{Microprocessor:} CPU combined with an integrated circuit
			&&& \emph{Sensor:} Device which converts a measured physical quantity into a signal
			&&& \emph{Actuator:} Mechanical device for moving/controlling a mechanism/systems

	& \emph{Computing system:}
		&& Purpose is to convert data to information

		&& Operations:
			&&& Input/output
				&&&& Communication to send/receive data
			&&& Storage (permanent/temporary)
			&&& Processing to transform data to information

		&& Main concepts:

			&&& \emph{Theory of the Universal Computing Device:} Given enough time and memory, all computers are capable of computing the same operations
			
			&&& \emph{Turing machine:} Mathematical model of a device which can perform any computation using discrete states and transitions between states
				&&&& Idea created by Alan Turing
				&&&& Ability to read and write symbols on an infinite `tape' (memory)
				&&&& \emph{Universal Turing Machine:} Machine which can implement all Turing machines
					&&&&& Programmable; instructions may be part of the input data
					&&&&& Can be emulated by a computer
				&&& E.g. Two computers A and B which have instructions which can add two values or produce the negative of a value, but B alone can subtract two values. A and B can compute the same operations.

			&&& Break-down of the levels of a computing system:
				&&&& Levels (high-level to low-level):
					&&&&& Natural language:
						&&&&&& May be ambiguous and imprecise
					&&&&& Algorithm:
						&&&&&& Step-by-step procedure
						&&&&&& Well-defined
						&&&&&& Finite
						&&&&&& Effective computability
					&&&&& Programming language:
						&&&&&& Expression of a program using a defined language
					&&&&& Instruction set architecture (ISA)
					&&&&& Microarchitecture:
						&&&&&& Organization of a processor implementation
						&&&&&& Implements a single ISA
					&&&&& Circuit:
						&&&&&& Combination of different structures to represent microarchitecture
					&&&&& Device:
						&&&&&& E.g. Capacitors, resistors, transistors
				&&&& Transformations between levels:
					&&&&& \emph{Software design:} Expression of a problem in a natural language with algorithms and data structures
					&&&&& \emph{Programming:} Implementation of algorithms and data structures using a programming language(s)
					&&&&& \emph{Compilation/interpretation:} Transformation of a program in a programming language into the instructions (in machine language) of a given instruction set
					&&&&& Circuits are created with small components such as gates
