\section{Ethics}
	\label{sec:ethics}
\begin{easylist}

	& Standard ethical procedures:
		&& \emph{Institutional review board:} Group which judges whether a study will provide valuable information and is statistically sound
		&& Having an institutional review board ensure that subjects are not harmed
		&& Collecting assurance of informed consent in advance from all subjects
			&&& Information about the nature, purpose, and possible risks of the study
			&&& Not required only when it concerns observation in a public area
		&& Prevention of any possible physical harm
		&& Keeping all data confidential and anonymous
		
	& Other considerations:
		&& Emotional harm
		&& Privacy
		&& Deception

	& Examples of unethical procedures:
		&& Selling products under the guise of conducting a survey
		&& Publishing fabricated data
		
	& \emph{Clinical trial:} Experiment which studies the effects of various medical treatments on human patients
		&& Risks for the current experimental patients; benefits for future patients
		&& Random comparative experiments ensure the real effects of a treatment are shown
		&& Medical ethics and international ethics support the interests of the subject over the interests of the society
			&&& Therefore, there is only reason to conduct clinical trials when there is:
				&&&& Sufficient reason to believe the treatment may help the experimental group
				&&&& Sufficient doubt to believe the treatment may help the control group
