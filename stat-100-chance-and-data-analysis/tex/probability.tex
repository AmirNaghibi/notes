\begin{easylist}

	& \emph{Experiment:} Process which creates a bag of outcomes
	& \emph{Sample space:} Set of all possible outcomes
		&& Denoted by $S$
	& \emph{Event:} Possible outcome which satisfies a given condition(s)
		&& Denoted by $E$

	& \emph{Probability:} Value between 0 and 1 (inclusive) representing the proportion of times an outcome/event is expected
		&& Denoted by $P(event)$
		&& Calculation:
		\begin{math}
			P(A) = \frac{|A|}{|S|}
		\end{math}
		where |X| is the number of outcomes for X
		&& 0 means the event is impossible; 1 means the event is certain
		&& Represented either by a fraction or a decimal value
		
		&& E.g. The probability of getting an odd number when rolling a 6-sided die:

		\begin{center}
			\begin{tabular}{ r @{ = } l }
				$S$ & Results of rolling a 6-sided die = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 \\
				$|S|$ & 6 \\
				$E$ & Getting an odd number = 1, 3, 5 \\
				$|E|$ & 3 \\
				$P(E)$ & $\frac{|E|}{|S|}$ = $\frac{3}{6}$ = 0.5
			\end{tabular}
